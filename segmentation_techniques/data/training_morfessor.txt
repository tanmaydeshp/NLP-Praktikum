DPA
:
Iraqi
authorities
announced
that
they
had
busted
up
3
terrorist
cells
operating
in
Baghdad
.
Two
of
them
were
being
run
by
2
officials
of
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
!
The
third
was
being
run
by
the
head
of
an
investment
firm
.
You
wonder
if
he
was
manipulating
the
market
with
his
bombing
targets
.
The
cells
were
operating
in
the
Ghazaliyah
and
al
-
Jihad
districts
of
the
capital
.
Although
the
announcement
was
probably
made
to
show
progress
in
identifying
and
breaking
up
terror
cells
,
I
do
n't
find
the
news
that
the
Baathists
continue
to
penetrate
the
Iraqi
government
very
hopeful
.
It
reminds
me
too
much
of
the
ARVN
officers
who
were
secretly
working
for
the
other
side
in
Vietnam
.

Guerrillas
killed
a
member
of
the
Kurdistan
Democratic
Party
after
kidnapping
him
in
Mosul

The
police
commander
of
Ninevah
Province
announced
that
bombings
had
declined
80
percent
in
Mosul
,
whereas
there
had
been
a
big
jump
in
the
number
of
kidnappings
.
On
Wednesday
guerrillas
had
kidnapped
a
cosmetic
surgeon
and
his
wife
while
they
were
on
their
way
home
.
In
Suwayrah
,
Kut
Province
,
two
car
bombs
were
discovered
before
they
could
be
detonated
.
(
Kut
is
in
southeastern
Iraq
and
has
an
overwhelmingly
Shiite
population
,
who
are
on
the
lookout
for
Baathist
saboteurs
and
willingly
turn
them
in
.
This
willingness
is
the
main
difference
in
the
number
of
bombings
in
the
south
as
opposed
to
the
center
-
north
of
the
country
.

In

Kadhim

dean
at

was
assassinated
with
his
driver
in

Salikh
district

Guerrillas
killed
an

,
Asi
Ali

They
also
killed
Shaikh
Hamid
'Akkab
,
a
clan
elder
of
a
branch
of
the
Dulaim
tribe
in
Tikrit
.
His
mother
was
also
killed

Two

have
been
killed
in
the
past
week
and

half

Guerrillas
near

launched
an
attack
that
left
6
dead

including
4
Iraqi
soldiers
.
One
of
them
was
from
the
Jubur
tribe
and
was
deputy
commander
of
the
Hawijah
garrison
.
(
This
is
a
largely
Sunni
Arab
clan
,
and
some
Sunni
observers
have
accused
Shiite
elements
in
the
government
of
being
behind
the
assassination
;
it
is
more
likely
the
work
of
Sunni
Arab
guerrillas
punishing
the
Batawi
leaders
for
cooperating
with
the
Dec.
15
elections
.

Al
-
Zaman
:
The
Iraqi
High
Electoral
Commission
on
Friday
denied
a
request
of
the
Debaathification
Commission
to
exclude
51
individuals
from
running
on
party
lists
in
the
Dec.
15
elections
on
grounds
of
having
been
sufficiently
involved
in
Baath
activities
to
warrant
their
being
excluded
from
civil
office
.
The
Commission
said
it
had
no
legal
grounds
for
such
an
exclusion
.
This
item
is
a
small
one
and
easily
missed
.
But
in
my
view
it
is
highly
significant
.
The
Debaathification
Commission
had
been
pushed
by
Ahmad
Chalabi
and
his
Iraqi
National
Congress
very
hard
,
and
had
pushed
many
Sunni
Arabs
into
the
arms
of
the
guerrillas
.
Chalabi
has
been
increasingly
marginalized
within
Iraq
,
however
,
despite
his
ties
of
clientelage
with
Washington
and
Tehran
.
He
is
no
longer
in
the
dominant
Shiite
list
,
the
United
Iraqi
Alliance
,
and
wo
n't
have
many
seats
in
the
new
parliament
.
Some
2,000
junior
officers
of
the
old
Baath
army
have
been
recalled
to
duty
in
recent
months
,
something
Chalabi
would
have
blocked
if
he
could
have
.
Now
the
Electoral
Commission
is
refusing
to
punish
people
for
mere
past
Baath
Party
membership
.
If
someone
committed
a
crime
against
humanity
,
prosecute
the
person
.
If
he
or
she
did
not
,
then
they
should
have
all
the
same
rights
as
other
Iraqis
.
Al

Sharq

Awsat
reports
that
a
key
eyewitness
in
the
trial
of
Saddam
Hussein
for
a
1982
massacre
at
Dujail
has
died
.
A
team
from
the
court
managed
to
take
his
deposition
before
he
died
.
The
trial
begins
again
Nov.
28
.
Baghdadis
do
n't
venture
much
out
of
their
neighbourhoods
any
more
,
you
never
know
where
you
might
get
stuck
.
There
has
been
talk
that
the
night
curfew
might
be
implemented
again
.
My
neighbourhood
has
been
surrounded
by
American
troops
for
three
days
now
,
helicopters
have
been
circling
over
our
heads
non-stop
.
Fedayeen
are
now
visible
on
the
street
and
they
have
become
bolder
than
ever
.
They
are
setting
the
road
blocks
at
the
exact
same
positions
they
were
during
the
war
last
year
,
which
indicates
they
are
the
same
people
.
And
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
really
,
people
who
are
suggesting
that
we
go
out
and
fight
them
are
living
in
dream
land
.
Even
the
IP
and
ICDC
have
abandoned
the
neighbourhood
,
and
those
are
trained
and
armed
,
so
do
n't
expect
scared
civilians
to
do
anything
except
to
hide
inside
and
pray
a
helicopter
or
a
tank
does
n't
bomb
them
,
and
also
how
are
American
soldiers
going
to
distinguish
the
brave
and
valiant
civilians
from
the
Fedayeen
?
Everyone
is
apprehensive
,
there
is
some
talk
that
April
9th
and
10th
are
going
to
be
bloody
days
.
Most
people
have
n't
gone
to
work
the
last
few
days
,
although
it
seems
that
the
rest
of
Baghdad
is
'
normal
'
(
if
you
can
define
what
normal
is
)
.
There
are
rumours
about
preparations
by
slum
dwellers
for
another
looting
spree
against
banks
,
governmental
and
public
property
similar
to
the
one
that
took
place
last
April
,
and
I
have
already
overheard
youngsters
in
my
neighbourhood
joking
about
it
and
saying
things
like
"
This
time
we
will
be
the
first
to
loot
,
we
did
n't
get
anything
the
last
time
"
.
Mosques
are
calling
for
donating
blood
,
food
,
and
medicine
for
Fallujah
,
and
several
convoys
have
already
headed
out
for
Fallujah
,
most
of
them
returned
later
though
.
So
what
happened
?
I
guess
it
's
just
the
old
new
Arab
'
Me
against
my
brother
,
me
and
my
brother
against
my
cousin
,
me
and
my
cousin
against
my

'
,
or
'
The
enemy
of
my
enemy
is
my
friend
'
thing
going
on
again
.
Speaking
of
Fallujah
,
we
have
only
Al
-
Jazeera
to
rely
on
for
our
news
from
there
.
They
have
sent
over
their
top
reporter
Ahmed
Mansour
to
the
town
,
and
he
is
spouting
all
kinds
of
propaganda
hourly
reminding
me
of
Al
-
Sahhaf
.
Over
300
Iraqis
are
reported
dead
and
500
reported
wounded
in
Fallujah
alone
.
Al
-
Iraqiyah
tv
said
that
ICDC
were
controlling
Ramadi
.
Elena
's
motorcycle
tour
through
the
region
around
Chernobyl
has
revived
interest
in
one
of
the
most
serious
nuclear
disasters
in
history
.
We
all
know
what
happened
,
but
even
to
this
day
,
there
are
many
different
versions
and
opinions
on
how
it
happened
and
what
effect
Chernobyl
will
have
on
the
health
of
people
affected
by
the
fallout
.
UPDATE
:
Now
you
can
tour
Chernobyl
and
write
your
own
story
.
This
is
not
a
post
about
fault
-
finding
or
assigning
blame
.
It
is
a
time
to
learn
what
happened
and
how
it
may
affect
the
future
.
This
was
heavily
promoted
by
the
Australasian
Radiation
Protection
Society
in
a
press
release
titled
THE
MYTHS
OF
CHERNOBYL
which
contained
the
following
:
CHERNOBYL
ACCIDENT
:
TEN
YEARS
ON
The
prestigious
IAEA
(
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency
)
published
an
early
report
on
Chernobyl
which
was
based
on
information
from
Russian
sources
and
stated
that
there
was
no
significant
health
effects
.
Here
are
some
excerpts
:
There
is
a
lot
to
learn
about
Chernobyl
.
Being
well
-
informed
will
give
you
certainty
and
that
is
desirable
in
a
world
of
conflicting
reports
.
There
are
a
wealth
of
references
on
Chernobyl
.
Read
some
of
the
following
links
and
draw
your
own
conclusions
.
I
would
be
interested
in
hearing
what
conclusions
you
reached
and
what
you
found
that
was
most
convincing
.

Remember
the
old

that

That

was

One
of
them
is
the
Rest
and
Recuperation
Program
,
wherein
a
child
can
come
to
the
US
for
a
few
weeks
in
the
summer
.
The
urge
to
protect
and
gather
them
all
in
is
almost
overwhelming
,
and
makes
me
more
grateful
for
the
blessings
I
have
.
Take
care
,
my
friend
,
Linda
I
'm
sorry
to
say
Elena
's
story
has
been
revealed
to
be
a
fake
.
What
do
the
new
al
-
Qaeda
videotape
and
audio
speeches
of
Bin
Laden
and
Ayman
al
-
Zawahiri
tell
us
about
the
hopes
of
the
remaining
top
leadership
of
the
organization
?
Musharraf
has
been
trying
to
purge
his
officer
corps
of
the
substantial
number
of
al
-
Qaeda
sympathizers
.
His
military
intelligence
has
captured
major
figures
like
Abu
Zubayda
and
Khalid
Shaykh
Muhammad
,
as
well
as
nearly
500
other
al
-
Qaeda
operatives
,
over
400
of
whom
the
Pakistanis
have
turned
over
to
the
US
.
Musharraf
held
elections
in
October
of
2002
,
in
which
center
-
right
parties
did
well
,
but
in
which
nearly
20
percent
of
parliament
seats
went
to
the
fundamentalist
religious
party
coalition
,
MMA
.
MMA
also
captured
the
Northwest
Frontier
Province
,
which
probably
shelters
Bin
Laden
and
al
-
Zawahiri
,
and
is
in
a
joint
government
of
Baluchistan
Province
,
also
on
the
Afghanistan
border
.
If
al
-
Qaeda
can
kill
Musharraf
or
instigate
a
military
coup
against
him
by
Islamist
junior
officers
,
they
can
hope
to
catapult
the
MMA
to
power
as
political
allies
and
hosts
.
They
would
thereby
gain
control
of
a
major
base
for
terrorist
operations
,
which
is
also
a
nuclear
power
.
All
this
is
highly
unlikely
,
as
with
most
al
-
Qaeda
crackpot
schemes
.
But
so
was
it
unlikely
that
a
small
group
of
Arab
mujahidin
would
virtually
take
over
Afghanistan
.
Response
:
The
US
must
do
whatever
it
can
to
strengthen
the
legitimacy
of
the
Pakistani
government
.
On
the
one
hand
,
it
should
pressure
Musharraf
to
take
off
his
uniform
and
run
for
president
in
a
fair
election
,
and
to
repeal
the
contentious
"
Legal
Framework
Order
"
that
essentially
perpetuates
his
dictatorship
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
US
should
strong
-
arm
India
and
Pakistan
into
a
final
settlement
of
the
Kashmir
issue
.
The
Kashmir
issue
generates
far
more
terrorism
,
and
even
the
threat
of
nuclear
war
,
than
Iraq
ever
did
.
Response
:
The
US
has
succeeded
in
politically
isolating
Hamas
,
and
started
the
process
of
cutting
off
its
funding
.
This
terrorist
organization
can
now
only
pull
off
far
less
sophisticated
bombings
and
attacks
.
It
should
continue
to
be
defanged
.
But
Sharon
's
iron
fist
is
simply
not
working
as
a
means
of
establishing
general
peace
,
and
the
Bush
administration
will
have
to
finally
apply
effective
pressure
on
Sharon
to
stop
his
outrages
in
and
colonization
of
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
.

)
Make
Iraq
another
Afghanistan
,
using
the
Republican
Right
's
own
tactics
against
them
.
Response
:
Iraq
is
actually
hostile
territory
for
al
-
Qaeda
,
and
without
Iraqi
sympathizers
it
can
not
succeed
there
.
Certainly
,
the
Shiites
already
hate
al
-
Qaeda
and
would
help
;
likewise
the
Kurds
.
The
Americans
have
to
put
away
their
free
-
market
fetishism
for
a
while
and
find
ways
of
creating
jobs
and
pumping
money
into
Iraqi
households
.
We
need
an
FDR
in
Iraq
,
not
a
Ronald
Reagan
.
Getting
the
Spanish
out
of
Iraq
is
n't
nearly
as
good
a
rallying
cry
for
al
-
Qaeda
in
the
Arab
world
as
getting
the
Americans
and
British
out
.
George
W.
Bush
alleged
Thursday
that
John
Edwards
lacks
the
experience
necessary
to
be
president
.
The
problem
with
this
argument
is
that
Bush
lacked
the
experience
necessary
to
be
president
when
he
ran
in
2000
,
so
this
sort
of
cheap
shot
just
hoists
him
by
his

Hiller
asked

was
only

query
on
the
leader
of

,
referring
to
Taiwanese
President

Can

October
12

an
elected
prime
minister
and
the
installation
in
power
of
the
Pakistan
military
,
then
the
world
's
strongest
supporter
of
the
Taliban
,
would
bring
"
stability
!
"
Musharraf
made
his
coup
in
part
because
of
the
military
's
anger
over
Prime
Minister
Nawaz
Sharif
's
willingness
to
back
down
from
confronting
India
over
Kashmir
,
so
that
he
explicitly
came
to
power
as
a
warmonger
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
ominous
I
found
Bush
's
performance
in
that
interview
.
I
still
remember
him
stuttering
about
"
the
General
,
"
unable
to
remember
Musharraf
's
name
.
He
obviously
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
,
though
he
demonstrated
a
number
of
ill
-
fated
instincts
.
He
obviously
liked
authoritarian
rule
better
than
democracy
,
equating
dictatorship
with
"
stability
.
"
And
,
he
did
n't
think
he
needed
to
know
anything
about
South
Asia
,
with
its
nuclear
giants
and
radical
religious
politics
--
the
latter
a
dire
security
threat
to
the
US
.
He
could
n't
tell
when
things
were
becoming
more
unstable
as
opposed
to
less
.
Musharraf
went
on
to
play
nuclear
brinkmanship
with
India
in
2002
,
risking
war
twice
that
year
.
Although
Musharraf
did
turn
against
the
Taliban
after
September
11
,
under
extreme
duress
from
the
US
,
elements
of
his
military
continued
to
support
radical
Islamism
and
have
recently
been
implicated
in
assassination
attempts
on
Musharraf
himself
.
This
was
the
body
that
Bush
proclaimed
was
bringing
"
stability
"
to
the
region
in
fall
of
1999
.
So
,
one
answer
to
Bush
's
charge
about
Edwards
is
that
if
it
had
any
merit
,
Bush
should
have
declined
to
run
himself
.
Another
answer
is
that
Edwards
certainly
knows
far
more
about
foreign
affairs
now
than
Bush
did
then
.
Indeed
,
given
how
Bush
has
rampaged
around
the
world
alienating
allies
and
ignoring
vital
conflicts
with
the
potential
to
blow
back
on
the
US
,
one
might
well
argue
that
Edwards
knows
more
now
than
Bush
does
.
This
is
what
Edwards
'
campaign
literature
said
about
his
positions
:
"
Edwards
believes
that
the
U.S.
must
be
an
active
leader
to
help
resolve
conflicts
,
from
reducing
tensions
between
India
and
Pakistan
to
the
peace
process
in
Northern
Ireland
.
Edwards
is
a
strong
supporter
of
Israel
,
and
believes
that
the
U.S.
has
a
vital
role
in
promoting
peace
between
the
Israelis
and
the
Palestinians
.
"
I
do
n't
see
Bush
doing
any
of
this
.
From
Friday
's
Daily
Star
By
Juan
Cole
Friday
,
June
04
,
2004
As
the
American
public
gradually
wearies
of
the
Iraq
crisis
,
some
have
begun
worrying
that
the
war
could
blow
back
on
the
US
by
creating
the
conditions
for
anti-American
terrorism
.
Ironically
,
among
the
strongest
proponents
of
war
in
Iraq
were
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ariel
Sharon
and
his
neoconservative
supporters
in
the
US
.
Have
they
,
however
,
actually
weakened
Israeli
security
?
The
biggest
threat
Israel
faces
is
not
from
conventional
armies
but
from
the
asymmetrical
tactics
of
Palestinian
national
liberation
movements
.
The
derailing
of
the
Oslo
peace
process
by
the
hard
-
line
policies
of
Sharon
and
the
Palestinian
intifada
has
encouraged
suicide
bombings
.
This
,
in
turn
,
has
discouraged
international
investment
in
Israel
and
has
made
it
less
likely
that
immigrants
to
the
country
will
actually
remain
there
.
Although
Israel
withdrew
from
Lebanese
territory
in
May
2000
,
the
radical
Lebanese
Shiite
party
,
Hizbullah
,
has
not
been
mollified
.
Any
thorough
assessment
of
the
impact
of
the
Iraq
war
and
its
aftermath
on
Israel
's
security
environment
must
,
therefore
,
closely
examine
its
likely
effect
on
the
conduct
of
asymmetrical
warfare
.
Although
it
is
often
alleged
(
without
much
evidence
)
that
Saddam
Hussein
gave
money
to
the
families
of
Palestinian
suicide
bombers
and
so
encouraged
asymmetrical
warfare
,
it
is
not
clear
that
he
actually
posed
a
danger
to
Israel
.
The
Palestinians
who
have
been
willing
to
kill
themselves
to
end
the
Israeli
occupation
of
the
Gaza
Strip
and
the
West
Bank
were
not
driven
by
economic
considerations
.
Saddam
never
did
anything
practical
to
help
the
Palestinians
.
At
some
points
,
as
in
the
late
1980s
,
he
reportedly
made
behind
-
the
-
scenes
overtures
to
the
Israelis
to
arrive
at
some
sort
of
a
deal
.
He
did
not
allow
Palestinian
radicals
to
launch
operations
against
Israel
from
Iraq
.
Its
ramshackle
army
had
virtually
collapsed
before
the
American
invasion
in
2003
.
If
it
is
hard
to
see
how
Baathist
Iraq
posed
any
real
threat
to
Israel
,
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
see
a
menace
in
the
current
instability
.
The
bungling
of
post-war
Iraq
by
the
Bush
administration
created
a
weak
and
failed
state
.
The
more
radical
Shiites
,
who
generally
follow
the
theocratic
notions
of
Iran
's
Ayatollah
Ruhollah
Khomeini
,
routinely
chant
and
demonstrate
against
Israel
.
They
vehemently
protested
the
Israeli
assassination
of
Sheikh
Ahmed
Yassin
,
the
leader
of
Hamas
,
last
March
.
These
Shiite
movements
had
been
suppressed
by
Saddam
Hussein
's
regime
,
but
have
now
organized
and
armed
themselves
.
They
have
also
reestablished
their
historical
links
with
Lebanese
and
Iranian
Shiites
.
It
is
inevitable
that
most
Iraqi
Shiites
will
side
with
their
Hizbullah
coreligionists
against
Israel
,
and
it
seems
likely
that
Iraqi
Shiites
will
get
rich
enough
from
Iraqi
petroleum
sales
in
the
future
that
they
will
be
in
a
good
position
to
bankroll
Lebanese
Shiite
radicals
.
Sunni
Arab
fundamentalists
deeply
sympathize
with
the
Palestinians
and
with
Hamas
,
and
those
in
Iraq
have
deep
historical
inks
with
fundamentalists
in
Jordan
and
Palestine
.
Iraqi
cities
such
as
Fallujah
and
Ramadi
were
on
the
truck
route
from
Amman
to
Baghdad
,
and
so
came
under
the
influence
of
the
Salafi
movement
,
which
is
popular
in
Jordan
.
Secular
Arab
nationalist
groups
also
universally
sympathize
with
the
Palestinians
,
and
those
in
post-Saddam
Iraq
are
no
exception
.
An
Iraq
in
which
armed
fundamentalist
and
nationalist
militias
proliferate
is
inevitably
a
security
worry
for
Israel
.
If
even
a
modicum
of
normality
and
security
can
be
returned
to
Iraq
,
its
citizens
will
be
able
to
benefit
from
the
country
's
petroleum
reserves
.
That
private
wealth
can
easily
be
funneled
into
aid
for
the
Palestinians
and
for
Lebanese
Shiites
.
Israel
's
security
interests
are
best
served
by
peace
with
its
neighbors
,
which
can
only
be
achieved
by
trading
land
for
peace
with
the
Palestinians
.
Ariel
Sharon
's
aggressive
near
annexation
of
almost
half
of
the
occupied
West
Bank
and
his
indefinite
postponement
of
any
Palestinian
state
have
created
unprecedented
rage
and
violence
.
The
anger
has
spread
throughout
the
Muslim
world
,
including
Iraq
.

India
defensive

While
India
is
ready
to
enter
into
a
"
defense
cooperation

"
with
Sri
Lanka
,
it
is
wary
of
being

into
any
military
involvement
in
the
island

's
two
decades
-
old
civil
war
that
has

violent
strife
between
ethnic
Tamils
and
the
Sinhalese
majority
-
leaving
over
60,000
dead
on
both
sides
.
And
that
explains
the
delay
in
the
signing
of
a
formal
defense

that
was
at
the
heart
of
Sri

President

For

Kumaratunga

military

.
The

but
would
be

in
deterring
the

from

sources
said
.
But
they
,
too
,
failed
.
Colombo
,
too
,
seems
to
be
in
an
intractable
position
.
The
Norwegians
mean
well
but
their
role
is
limited
to
that
of
honest
broker
and
the
LTTE
is
keenly
aware
that
they
do
not
have
the
power
[
unlike
India
]
to
underwrite
any
arrangement
,
Kalkat
told
IPS
in
an
interview
.
Under
the
accord
,
a
new
northeastern
provincial
council
was
formed
and
the
Indian
army
was
deployed
as
peacekeepers
in
the
north
and
east
.
However
,
differences
between
India
and
LTTE
soon
surfaced
and
led
to
clashes
between
Tiger
guerrillas
and
the
Indian
peace
keeping
force
.
About
1,200
Indian
soldiers
were
killed
during
this
phase
of
the
conflict
.
India
had
to
pull
back
its
forces
from
Sri
Lanka
in
1989
following
the
election
of
Ranasinghe
Premadasa
,
a
strong
critic
of
Indian
mediation
.
Last
June
,
an
international
initiative
led
by
Japan
to
persuade
the
LTTE
to
come
back
to
the
negotiating
table
failed
despite
an
aid
package
offer
of
US$
4.5
billion
.
Japan
's
special
envoy
,
Yasushi
Akashi
,
who
called
for
tangible
progress
in
the
peace
process
before
the
money
would
be
released
,
came
back
from
visits
to
Colombo
and
Kilinochchi
in
early
November
a
frustrated
man
.
He
complained
about
the
"
visible
lack
of

"
and
reaching
an
impasse
in
talks
with
both
sides
.
But
there
are

Unreported
by
the

,
the
Valley
of
Kashmir
has
seen
an
ethnic
and
cultural
genocide
that
has
resulted
in
the
fleeing
from
the
valley
of
almost
all
the
Hindu
families
who
have
been
living
there
since
human

was
first

Over
nine
dozen

have
been
destroyed
,
with
some
used

.
Thus
far
,
none
of
the
many
"

across
the

have
bothered
to
even
notice
such
a
development

Musharraf
calls
the
bluff
M.D.
Nalapat
While
most
U.S.
secretaries
of
state
--
save
perhaps
Dean
Rusk
--
have
gobbled
up
credit
for
outcomes
that
they
had
little
to
do
with
,
few
have
been
as
brazen
as
Colin
Powell
.
Two
years
ago
,
Pakistani
President
Pervez
Musharraf
was
surprised
when
the
leader
of
the
main
Islamist
alliance
--
Maulana
Fazlur
Rahman
--
visited
India
and
issued
a
series
of
highly
conciliatory
statements
.
The
reality
is
that
India
is
no
longer
the
enemy
of
choice
for
the
people
of
Pakistan
.
Realists
,
and
this
even
includes
members
of
the
U.S.
Democratic
foreign
policy
establishment
such
as
Strobe
Talbott
,
who
have
long
sought
to
divest
India
of
its
defensive
capability
against
another
nuclear
power
in
Asia
,
understand
the
only
feasible
solution
for
Kashmir
is
the
acceptance
of
the
status
quo
.
India
keeps
what
it
has
while
Pakistan
and
China
(
which
was
gifted
a
slice
of
the
territory
three
decades
ago
)
do
likewise
.
Bill
Clinton
understood
this
at
the
end
of
his
term
in
office
yet
,
under
Colin
Powell
(
who
appears
to
have
an
affinity
for
generals
active
in
politics
)
,
the
pendulum
of
U.S.
policy
has
once
again
swung
toward
a
quixotic
effort
to
prize
at
least
the
Valley
of
Kashmir
loose
from
India
.
This
,
Pakistan
's
lobbyist
in
Washington
Christina
Rocca
has
been
told
,
is
the
"
minimum
"
that
the
Pakistan
army
will
accept
.
It
is
also
far
more
than
what
any
administration
in
New
Delhi
can
deliver
.

across
the

have

to

.
Unfortunately
for
them
,
the
general
has
decided
to
take
seriously
Colin
Powell
's
frequent
boasts
that
it
was
on
his
nudging
that
the
Indians
made
conciliatory
gestures
toward
Islamabad
.
The
U.S.
State
Department
and
the
misnamed
think
tanks
that
follow
its
lead
have
held
numerous
conferences
on
Kashmir
and
,
in
most
of
them
,
the
solution
that
has
emerged
is
a
valley
prized
loose
from
Indian
control
and
under
its
own
version
of
Ibrahim
Rugova
.
That
India
is
not
Yugoslavia
and
that
the
"
foreigner
-
led
"
Indian
National
Congress
can
least
afford
to
ignore
Indian
nationalism
,
has
not
struck
the
conferees
,
among
whom
have
been
several
Indian
"
scholars
"
and
"
analysts
"
ready
to
say
and
endorse
anything
for
the
sake
of
a
free
trip
to
New
York
or
Vienna
.
Despite
many
wrinkles
,
India
remains
a
part
-
democracy
and
merely
signing
on
to
a
piece
of
paper
that
calls
for
an
independent
Kashmir
does
not
get
you
into
the
trouble
that
writing
an
op
-
ed
piece
against
Sonia
Gandhi
or
Atal
Behari
Vajpayee
would
instantly
.
It
was
the
business
community
in
India
that
stepped
in
after
Vajpayee
indulged
in
an
empty

of
the
mythical
perception
that
war

especially
nuclear
war
--

around

was
China
.
Since
then

Ok
.
We
all
know
that
John
Kerry
served
in
Vietnam
.
Four
whole
months
,
after
which
he
took
advantage
of
a
little
-
known
,
little
-
invoked
regulation
that
allowed
him
to
desert
his
"
band
of
brothers
"
.
During
his
time
in
the
Guard
,
George
Bush
flew
the
F
-
102
Delta
Dagger
fighter
-
interceptor
.
The
F
-
102
saw
service
in
the
Vietnam
theater
between
March
1962
and
December
1969
.

As
far
as
George
Bush
knew
,
he
and
his
unit
could
have
been
transferred
to
Vietnam
.
In
all
this
so
-
called
controversy
,
has
anyone
considered
that
perhaps
George
Bush
just
wanted
to
fly
jets
?
And
,
let
's
remember
,
flying
supersonic
fighter
jets
is
dangerous
!
They
do
n't
let
just
anybody
do
it
.
Some
reporters
(
you
know
,
the
ones
with
journalistic
ethics
)
have
actually
uncovered
the
truth
about
George
Bush
's
service
in
the
Texas
Air
National
Guard
.
For
example
,
did
you
know
that
George
Bush
spent
considerably
more
time
in
uniform
than
John
Kerry
?

---------
Bush
â€™s
National
Guard
years
What
do
you
really
know
about
George
W.
Bush
â€™s
time
in
the
Air
National
Guard
?
That
he
did
nâ€™t
show
up
for
duty
in
Alabama
?
That
he
missed
a
physical
?
That
his
daddy
got
him
in
?
News
coverage
of
the
president
â€™s
years
in
the
Guard
has
tended
to
focus
on
one
brief
portion
of
that
time
â€”
to
the
exclusion
of
virtually
everything
else
.
So
just
for
the
record
,
here
,
in
full
,
is
what
Bush
did
:
The
future
president
joined
the
Guard
in
May
1968
.
Almost
immediately
,
he
began
an
extended
period
of
training
.
Six
weeks
of
basic
training
.
Fifty
-
three
weeks
of
flight
training
.
Twenty
-
one
weeks
of
fighter
-
interceptor
training
.
That
was
80
weeks
to
begin
with
,
and
there
were
other
training
periods
thrown
in
as
well
.
It
was
full
-
time
work
.
By
the
time
it
was
over
,
Bush
had
served
nearly
two
years
.
Not
two
years
of
weekends
.
Two
years
.
As
he
did
,
he
accumulated
points
toward
his
National
Guard
service
requirements
.
According
to
records
released
earlier
this
year
,
Bush
earned
253
points
in
his
first
year
,
May
1968
to
May
1969
(
since
he
joined
in
May
1968
,
his
service
thereafter
was
measured
on
a
May
-
to
-
May
basis
)
.
Bush
earned
340
points
in
1969
-
1970
.
[
In
other
words
,
Bush
earned
enough
points
to
satisfy
the
requirements
for
his
entire
six
year
hitch
in
1969
-
1970
alone
.
-
acd
]
He
earned
137
points
in
1970
-
1971
.
And
he
earned
112
points
in
1971
-
1972
.
The
numbers
indicate
that
in
his
first
four
years
,
Bush
not
only
showed
up
,
he
showed
up
a
lot
.
Did
you
know
that
?
That
brings
the
story
to
May
1972
â€”
the
time
that
has
been
the
focus
of
so
many
news
reports
â€”
when
Bush
â€œ
deserted
â€
(
according
to
anti-Bush
filmmaker
Michael
Moore
)
or
went
â€œ
AWOL
â€
(
according
to
Terry
McAuliffe
,
chairman
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
)
.
Bush
asked
for
permission
to
go
to
Alabama
to
work
on
a
Senate
campaign
.
His
superior
officers
said
OK
.
Requests
like
that
were
nâ€™t
unusual
,
says
retired
Col.
William
Campenni
,
who
flew
with
Bush
in
1970
and
1971
.
â€œ
In
1972
,
there
was
an
enormous
glut
of
pilots
,
â€
Campenni
says
.
â€œ
The
Vietnam
War
was
winding
down
,
and
the
Air
Force
was
putting
pilots
in
desk
jobs
.
In
â€™72
or
â€™73
,
if
you
were
a
pilot
,
active
or
Guard
,
and
you
had
an
obligation
and
wanted
to
get
out
,
no
problem
.
In
fact
,
you
were
helping
them
solve
their
problem
.
â€
So
Bush
stopped
flying
.
From
May
1972
to
May
1973
,
he
earned
just
56
points
â€”
not
much
,
but
enough
to
meet
his
requirement
.
Then
,
in
1973
,
as
Bush
made
plans
to
leave
the
Guard
and
go
to
Harvard
Business
School
,
he
again
started
showing
up
frequently
.
In
June
and
July
of
1973
,
he
accumulated
56
points
,
enough
to
meet
the
minimum
requirement
for
the
1973
-
1974
year
.
Then
,
at
his
request
,
he
was
given
permission
to
go
.
Bush
received
an
honorable
discharge
after
serving
five
years
,
four
months
and
five
days
of
his
original
six
-
year
commitment
.
By
that
time
,
however
,
he
had
accumulated
enough
points
in
each
year
to
cover
six
years
of
service
.
During
his
service
,
Bush
received
high
marks
as
a
pilot
.
A
1970
evaluation
said
Bush
â€œ
clearly
stands
out
as
a
top
notch
fighter
interceptor
pilot
â€
and
was
â€œ
a
natural
leader
whom
his
contemporaries
look
to
for
leadership
.
â€
A
1971
evaluation
called
Bush
â€œ
an
exceptionally
fine
young
officer
and
pilot
â€
who
â€œ
continually
flies
intercept
missions
with
the
unit
to
increase
his
proficiency
even
further
.
â€
And
a
1972
evaluation
called
Bush
â€œ
an
exceptional
fighter
interceptor
pilot
and
officer
.
â€
Now
,
it
is
only
natural
that
news
reports
questioning
Bush
â€™s
service
â€”
in
The
Boston
Globe
and
The
New
York
Times
,
on
CBS
and
in
other
outlets
â€”
would
come
out
now
.
And
,
as
it
is
with
Kerry
,
it
â€™s
reasonable
to
look
at
a
candidate
â€™s
entire
record
,
including
his
military
service
â€”
or
lack
of
it
.
Voters
are
perfectly
able
to
decide
whether
it
â€™s
important
or
not
in
November
.
The
Kerry
camp
blames
Bush
for
the
Swift
boat
veterans
â€™
attack
,
but
anyone
who
has
spent
much
time
talking
to
the
Swifties
gets
the
sense
that
they
are
doing
it
entirely
for
their
own
reasons
.
And
it
should
be
noted
in
passing
that
Kerry
has
personally
questioned
Bush
â€™s
service
,
while
Bush
has
not
personally
questioned
Kerry
â€™s
.
In
April
â€”
before
the
Swift
boat
veterans
had
said
a
word
â€”
Kerry
said
Bush
â€œ
has
yet
to
explain
to
America
whether
or
not
,
and
tell
the
truth
,
about
whether
he
showed
up
for
duty
.
â€
Earlier
,
Kerry
said
,
â€œ
Just
because
you
get
an
honorable
discharge
does
not
,
in
fact
,
answer
that
question
.
â€
Now
,
after
the
Swift
boat
episode
,
the
spotlight
has
returned
to
Bush
.
That
â€™s
fine
.
We
should
know
as
much
as
we
can
.
And
perhaps
someday
Kerry
will
release
more
of
his
military
records
as
well
.
Byron
York
is
a
White
House
correspondent
for
National
Review
.
His
column
appears
in
The
Hill
each
week
.
One
week
to
elections
day
and
the
general
atmosphere
in
the
capital
is
eerie
,
yet
strikingly
familiar
.
I
suspect
the
streets
of
Baghdad
will
look
as
if
a
war
is
looming
this
week
.
The
interim
government
has
promised
security
measures
that
would
reduce
the
violence
on
the
day
of
elections
,
but
I
fail
to
see
how
they
will
be
able
to
protect
all
5,000
(
or
so
)
balloting
centres
.
Now
that
the
picture
is
clear
,
the
two
main
competing
lists
seem
to
be
the
United
Iraqi
Coalition
list
and
Allawi
's
Al
-
Iraqiya
list
.
Ayad
Allawi
,
and
other
ministers
running
on
his
list
,
have
quite
expectedly
used
their
governmental
positions
in
campaigning
.
One
minister
reportedly
handed
out
100
dollar
'
gifts
'
to
journalists
attending
a
press
conference
for
Allawi
,
a
practice
that
brings
back
bad
memories
to
many
Iraqis
.
Sheikh
Naji
Al
-
Abbudi
,
a
spokesman
for
Sistani
,
affirmed
the
claims
that
the
Grand
Ayatollah
is
backing
the
United
Iraqi
Coalition
list
.
Indeed
,
Sistani
's
agents
all
over
the
country
have
been
quite
active
in
educating
Iraqi
Shia
on
the
merits
of
elections
,
which
has
led
to
the
assassination
of
at
least
two
of
them
.
Al
-
Abbudi
stated
that
"
His
Emminence
"
decided
to
openly
support
the
list
because
"
others
"
(
obviously
a
reference
to
Allawi
)
have
been
abusing
official
state
positions
and
media
outlets
in
their
campaigning
.
Again
there
is
no
official
written
statement
from
Sistani
's
office
confirming
this
allegation
,
which
I
think
is
intentional
.
Ahmed
Al
-
Chalabi
and
defense
minister
Hazim
Al
-
Sha'lan
have
been
engaging
in
shrill
public
attacks
over
the
media
.
Chalabi
describing
Sha'lan
as
a
"
Ba'athist
"
and
a
"
former
double
agent
for
Saddam
and
the
CIA
"
,
while
Sha'lan
dismisses
Chalabi
as
a
"
thief
"
and
an
"
Iranian
stooge
who
longs
for
his
own
origins
by
defending
Iran
"
.
One
remark
made
by
Sha'lan
on
Al
-
Arabiya
TV
,
that
he
could
n't
say
more
about
Chalabi
because
he
would
embarrass
himself
and
the
viewers
almost
made
me
roll
on
the
floor
.
It
was
an
extremely
amusing
episode
,
watching
Chalabi
looking
smug
and
amused
,
contrasted
with
Sha'lan
,
all
serious
and
barely
keeping
himself
from
swearing
.
Fistfights
,
please
.
Hazim
Al
-
Sha'lan
,
by
the
way
,
is
the
son
of
the
late
Sheikh
of
Al
-
Khaza'il
in
Diwaniya
and
has
the
potential
to
replace
former
information
minister
,
M.S.
Al
-
Sahaf
,
in
his
nonsensical
media
statements
,
which
can
be
passed
as
jokes
.
The
main
Kurdish
coalition
list
(
PUK
and
KDP
)
is
barely
mentioned
outside
the
Kurdish
region
.
Even
there
,
many
Kurds
look
and
act
as
if
they
are
going
to
grab
the
chance
to
vote
them
out
of
power
.
I
doubt
that
will
be
the
outcome
though
.
Many
Iraqis
,
including
conservative
and
religious
Iraqis
,
are
surprisingly
rooting
for
the
Iraqi
Communist
party
,
probably
in
an
attempt
to
counter
the
influence
of
Islamists
in
the
forthcoming
National
Assembly
.
Its
support
base
is
much
larger
than
what
it
seems
.
***
Several
candidates
were
assassinated
and
targeted
these
last
two
weeks
,
others
have
been
forced
under
threats
to
withdraw
and
to
follow
the
example
of
the
Islamic
party
.
Sectarian
tensions
are
at
their
highest
since
April
,
2004
,
with
Sunni
insurgents
now
openly
attacking
Husseiniyas
and
Shia
mosques
.
I
had
an
interesting
conversation
with
a
middle
-
aged
taxi
driver
who
used
to
live
in
Fallujah
and
is
now
at
relatives
in
Amiriya
,
Baghdad
.
He
described
Allawi
's
face
as
that
of
a
f*ed
horse
and
he
dismissed
the
whole
government
as
a
band
of
thieves
and
traitors
.
I
did
n't
argue
with
him
but
I
asked
him
what
he
believed
would
be
a
viable
solution
to
this
mess
.
He
said
that
resistance
was
the
only
commonsense
solution
.
First
driving
out
the
Americans
,
then
fighting
the
Shia
back
into
submission
(
as
in
1991
)
.
Sunni
Iraqis
contend
that
elections
are
impossible
to
hold
under
occupation
.
On
sensing
my
incredulity
to
his
statement
he
asserted
that
Ba'athist
cells
exist
in
all
parts
of
the
country
and
that
they
do
have
a
central
command
,
even
though
many
have
formed
seperate
cells
(
often
under
Islamic
labels
)
with
their
own
leaderships
.
He
said
that
they
have
the
training
and
the
funding
as
well
as
the
support
of
neighbouring
and
regional
governments
.
I
concur
that
Ba'athists
and
former
security
forces
are
capable
of
immediately
controlling
at
least
5
out
of
18
governorates
,
along
with
the
capital
,
if
Americans
are
to
be
removed
from
the
picture
entirely
.
Any
government
that
assumes
power
after
the
elections
also
realises
this
,
so
not
even
Sistani
is
going
to
call
the
US
to
withdraw
its
troops
,
despite
what
he
is
saying
now
,
not
until
they
are
ensured
the
insurgency
is
out
of
the
picture
,
or
that
they
have
an
alternative
foreign
power
(
in
this
case
Iran
)
to
back
them
up
.
The
only
hope
now
is
that
,
following
the
elections
,
the
National
Assembly
would
offer
the
hand
of
peace
and
reconciliation
to
the
dissenting
parties
.
Many
of
these
Sheikhs
have
been
disenfranchised
and
abused
over
the
last
two
years
.
Very
recently
,
US
forces
in
Al
-
Anbar
made
a
terrible
blunder
by
accidentally
killing
Abdul
-
Razaq
Inad
Al
-
Gu'ud
,
Sheikh
of
the
Al
-
Bu
Nimr
clan
from
the
powerful
Dulaym
tribe
.
Al
-
Gu'ud
had
favoured
elections
and
was
in
good
terms
with
the
government
.
The
Gu'ud
family
even
accepted
to
be
offered
the
seat
of
Al
-
Anbar
governor
some
months
back
.
The
revolt
took
two
weeks
to
be
suppressed
by
the
Republican
Guard
.
Another
bad
step
was
the
recent
arrest
of
Sheikh
Hassan
Al
-
Lihabi
,
of
the
Lihaib
tribe
which
is
scattered
between
the
governorates
of
Al
-
Anbar
,
Mosul
and
Salah
Al
-
Din
.
Al
-
Lihaibi
was
running
in
elections
and
is
now
said
to
have
withdrawn
following
this
incident
.
I
believe
national
reconciliation
to
be
the
only
path
forward
to
a
new
Iraq
.
Both
have
shared
this
country
for
the
last
14
centuries
and
there
is
no
possible
way
that
one
can
live
without
the
other
.
Even
partition
is
not
a
possibility
,
there
are
no
clear
borders
between
the
two
.
Remember

with

and
former
CIA
operative
in
a
luxury
condo
,
published
yesterday
.
(
"
At
first
I
hid
a
lot
.
I
thought
the
US
government
was
looking
for
me
.
Now
I
hide
a
lot
less
.
"
)
Because
of
such
talk
,
Posada
has
been
taken
into
custody
by
Immigration
officials
.
I
ca
n't
imagine
they
wanted
to
do
this
.
Authorities
would
likely
have
been
happy
answering
questions
about
Posada
's
whereabouts
with
an
indefinite
shrug
.
As
recently
as
last
week
the
official
line
stated
they
had
no
knowledge
he
had
entered
the
country
.
But
comfortable
among
the
thugs
,
Posada
overplayed
his
hand
and
embarrassed
his
old
patron
,
the
US
government
.
And
though
he
'd
been
a
faithful
servant
,
he
was
not
such
a
player
that
he
could
get
away
with
that
.
He
should
have
taken
a
cue
from
another
bomber
some
pesky
dark
-
skinned
foreigners
want
extradited
,
CIA
operative
Michael
Meiring
.
Posada
should
have
told
any
inquisitive
journalist
at
his
doorstep
something
like
Meiring
told
the
single
American
reporter
who
bothered
following
his
bloody
trail
from
the
Philippines
,
that
"
If
this
harms
me
in
any
way
,
you
will
find
my
power
then
,
and
you
'll
find
out
who
I
am
.
"
But
then
,
maybe
that
would
n't
have
saved
him
either
,
because
Posada
is
not
Meiring
.
Posada
can
be
given
up
,
but
Meiring
ca
n't
.
Meiring
's
crimes
are
fresh
,
and
wave
the
false
flag
which
is
the
"
War
on
Terror
.
"
They
happened
in
the
Philippines
which
,
like
Pakistan
,
is
an
important
and
vulnerable
node
for
the
business
which
intelligence
agencies
and
terrorist
organizations
conduct
with
each
other
.
(
Ask
Terry
Nichols
about
the
Philippines
.
)
Posada
's
crimes
,
on
the
other
hand
,
must
seem
like
ancient
history
,
especially
to
a
people
who
do
n't
know
their
history
.
And
to
those
who
do
n't
even
know
their
crimes
,
not
even
that
.
But
will
Posada
be
given
up
?
I
doubt
he
will
be
extradited
to
Venezuela
,
which
is
the
only
way
that
question
could
be
answered
with
a
Yes
.
I
expect
it
will
be
determined
that
,
under
"
Strong
Man
"
Hugo
Chavez
,
Posada
could
not
be
guaranteed
a
fair
trial
.
The
hope
may
be
that
Posada
can
soon
be
offered
to
a
post-Chavez
Allawi
-
like
puppet
in
Caracas
.
Whether
such
an
offer
were
accepted
or
declined
would
make
no
difference
;
justice
would
not
be
served
then
.
But
Posada
's
nearly
80
years
old
,
and
the
Venezuelan
people
will
ensure
that
's
a
vain
hope
.
So
instead
Posada
may
be
held
indefinitely
,
in
comfortable
custody
.
An
embarrassment
to
the
US
still
,
just
not
as
embarrassing
as
having
the
old
killer
strut
about
Miami
,
gloating
in
his
freedom
.
Meiring
is
more
than
an
embarrassment
.
His
case
threatens
the
consensus
fiction
of
the
"
War
on
Terror
.
"
So
his
name
will
remain
unspoken
.
Another
connection
to
Philippine
terror
and
weapons
smuggling
-
dating
from
the
1980s
-
is
alleged
in
the
book
Disposable
Patriot
,
by
Jack
Terrell
.
Terrell
,
a
CIA
asset
originally
recruited
for
the
Contra
effort
,
identifies
the
man
attempting
to
recruit
him
into
the
Philippine
scheme
as
Oliver
North
...
I
seem
to
recall
the
object
was
to
smuggle
explosives
.
Peter
Dale
Scott
includes
an
account
of
how
Terrell
's
whistleblowing
was
stifled
by
them
in
his
book
Cocaine
Politics
.

Due
to
the
Judge
in
the
1983
case
ruling
that
a
CIA
agent
could
not
testify
using
a
pseudonym
,
therefore
opening
him
to
cross-examination
by
Wilson
,
the
prosecution
had
a
problem
.
They
needed
someone
that
could
convince
the
jury
they
had
been
able
to
see
all
relevant
documents
in
CIA
files
on
Wilson
.
Wilson
was
claiming
that
he
had
been
working
for
the
CIA
when
he
sold
the
C
-
4
to
Quaddaffi
.
The
prosecution
was
charging
he
was
a
rogue
using
his
contacts
from
former
service
in
both
CIA
and
the
'
Office
of
Naval
Intelligence
'
.
Wilson
had
been
able
to
show
that
he
'd
had
more
than
80
"
non-social
contacts
"
with
the
CIA
since
his
retirement
in
1971
,
leaving
the
prosecution
's
case
in
turmoil
.
Then
Charles
A.
Briggs
came
to
the
rescue
.
The
Briggs
Declaration
states
that
with
one
exception
in
1972
,
Wilson
did
not
work
"
directly
or
indirectly
"
for
the
CIA
since
retiring
.
Last
week
,
Federal
District
Judge
Lynn
Hughes
in
Huston
,
Texas
,
threw
out
Wilson
's
two
-
decades
old
conviction
.
Judge
Hughes
wrote
:
`
government
knowingly
used
false
evidence
against
him
,
'
concluding
`
honesty
comes
hard
to
government
.
'
looks
like
it
is
rearing
its
head
again

In

These
alleged
members
of
the
Arakan
Army
,
the
military
wing
of
the
National
Unity
Party
in
Myanmar
,
have
been
charged
with
illegal
entry
.
It
is
likely
,
but
not
certain
,
that
they
will
be
deported
to
Myanmar
.
Correspondents
who
flocked
in
to
cover
the
tsunami
found
they
also
had
another
story
-
the
miserable
security
situation
surrounding
the
Indian
navy
's
Far
Eastern
Naval
Command
,
now
being
established
along
with
India
's
"
blue

navy
"
.
Deteriorating
security
Security
problems
in
the
Andaman
Sea
are
not
new
,
but
they
have
deteriorated
during
the
past
few
years
,
in
tandem
with
a
deterioration
in
the
security
situation
in
Bangladesh
,
Nepal
and
Bhutan
,
and
particularly
in
the
northeastern
Indian
states
of
Manipur
,
Nagaland
and
Tripura
.
The
Andaman
Sea
is
a
major
conduit
for
this
traffic
,
and
the
572
large
and
small
islands
that
constitute
the
Andaman
and
Nicobar
group
are
a
natural
transit
base
.
The
drugs
and
arms
travel
in
all
directions
.
This
is
not
unknown
to
New
Delhi
.
Reports
from
Port
Blair
make
it
evident
that
New
Delhi
gets
little
on
-
the
-
ground
intelligence
,
and
the
Indian
Coast
Guard
is
grossly
unequipped
to
deal
with
the
surge
of
illegal
migrants
to
the
islands
.
One
unnamed
naval
officer
was
quoted
saying
,
"
Arms
smuggling
is
a
very
profitable
business
in
this
region
.
"
Considering
the
islands
'
huge
strategic
importance
,
it
is
amazing
how
lax
New
Delhi
has
been
.
These
islands
sit
aside
the
vital
sea
lanes
of
the
Strait
of
Malacca
,
through
which
300
tankers
and
merchant
ships
pass
daily
,
bringing
in
oil
for
the
Far
East
and
Southeast
Asia

Intelligence
lapses
In
recent
months
,
its
fallibility
has
become
evident
.
The
inability
to
foresee
in
advance
the
assassination
attempt
on
the
pro-India
political
leader
and
former
Bangladeshi
prime
minister
Sheikh
Hasina
Wazed
last

and
the
recent
"

by
Nepalese
King
Gyanendra
dismissing
his
government
and
imposing
a
virtual
absolute
monarchy
,
are
glaring
examples
of
intelligence
failure
.
With
growing
economic
and
military
power
,
India
will
be
dependent
on
smaller
nations
in
the
region
increasingly
to
maintain
regional
security
.
Unless
New
Delhi
does
better
in
providing
security
to
its
own
nationals
against
rebels
,
secessionists
,
drug
runners
and
arms
traffickers
,
it
will
not
generate
much
confidence
in
the
capitals
of
surrounding
nations
.
Indian
intelligence
's
lackluster
performance
in
dealing
with
the
LTTE
is
startling
.
In
2001
,
according
to
Indian
army
officials
,
security
forces
launched
a
wide
-
ranging
operation
in
the
300
-
some
inhabited
islands
neighboring
Andaman
and
Nicobar
,
and
found
huge
caches
of
arms
.
The
arms
were
said
to
belong
to
the
LTTE
and
"
other
terrorist
groups
"
.
The
search
-
and
-
destroy
operation
was
carried
out
by
the
Indian
government
after
repeated
requests
from
Colombo
.
In
addition
,
LTTE
activity
in
the
Andaman
Sea
is
well
known
to
local
observers
.
The
biggest
LTTE
maritime
disaster
was
reported
in
the
now
-
defunct
Asiaweek
in
2001
.
A
shipment
of
weapons
,
ammunition
and
explosives
,
believed
to
have
been
purchased
from
Cambodia
and
worth
several
million
dollars
,
left
the
port
of
Phuket
in
Thailand
in
early
February
2001
aboard
the
freighter
Comex
-
Joux
3
.
As
is
LTTE
standard
procedure
,
the
vessel
changed
its
name
at
sea
to
Horizon
.
On
its
journey
across
the
Bay
of
Bengal
the
freighter
was
tracked
by
the
Indian
navy
and
Orissa
-
based
spy
planes
of
India
's
Aviation
Research
Center
;
it
was
intercepted
by
Indian
naval
vessels
off
Sri
Lanka
's
east
coast
.
LTTE
arms
-
running
In
1997
,
the
Thai
navy
reported
the
interception
of
a
16
-
meter
boat
after
a
chase
off
the
Thai
port
of
Ranong
,
and
the
confiscation
of
two
tons
of
weapons
and
ammunition
.
Among
the
weapons
intercepted
were
two
rocket
-
propelled
-
grenade
launchers
,
20
assault
rifles
,
M
-
79
grenade
launchers
and
more
than
10,000
rounds
of
ammunition
.
Four
persons
were
arrested
,
reportedly
belonging
to
the
Manipur
Revolutionary
People
's
Front
.
Six
crew
members
were
from
the
Arakan
region
of
Myanmar
.
The
boat
was
heading
toward
Cox
's
Bazar
in
Bangladesh
.
Until
1995
the
LTTE
maintained
a
base
at
Twante
,
an
island
off
the
coat
of
Myanmar
,
west
of
the
Andaman
islands
.
Subsequently
,
Phuket
became
the
LTTE
's
main
backup
base
.
A
Sri
Lanka
-
born
Tamil
with
a
Norwegian
passport
was
arrested
by
Thai
authorities
in
2000
for
his
links
with
the
LTTE
.
At
the
time
of
his
arrest
,
the
suspect
was
allegedly
involved
in
constructing
a
"
submarine
"
in
a
shipyard
on
the
island
of
Sirae
near
Phuket
on
the
Andaman
Sea
coast
.
Steady
buildup
Over
the
past
decade
,
Bangladesh
has
steadily
moved
into
a
state
of
lawlessness
.
A
number
of
extremist
groups
,
under
the
cover
of
the
Islamist
movement
,
have
become
active
in
drug
trafficking
,
gun
running
and
anti-Indian
activities
.
It
is
widely
acknowledged
that
the
Pakistani
ISI
has
nurtured
a
number
of
extremist
Islamist
groups
,
such
as
the
Harkat
-
ul
-
Jehad
-
al
-
Islami
,
in
the
port
city
of
Chittagong
,
and
put
a
number
of
secessionist
rebels
from
India
's
northeast
in
touch
with
this
terrorist
network
.
A
pattern
of
arrests
and
seizures
indicate
that
arms
are
brought
by
the
LTTE
from
Laos
,
Cambodia
and
Thailand
into
Chittagong
,
from
where
they
are
transported
northward
by
land
to
Bhutan
.
The
route
from
Kalikhola
in
Bhutan
to
Cox
's
Bazar
passes
through
northern
Bengal
,
Assam
and
Meghalaya
,
and
on
into
Chittagong
.
Note
Stretching
750
kilometers
from
end
to
end
,
they
reach
from
near
the
coast
of
Myanmar
almost
to
Sumatra
in
Indonesia

On
South
Andaman

the
most
heavily

island

is
Port

,
which
is

landlocked
Afghanistan
has
suffered
from
constant
interference
from
its
neighbours
-
Pakistan
,
Iran
and
the
Central
Asian
Republics
-
and
regional
powers
-
Russia
and
India
.
The
neighbours
are
still
interfering
,
but
there
are
signs
that
rather
than
undermining
Afghanistan
â€™s
stability
they
may
now
be
trying
to
strengthen
it
.
â€œ
The
elections
should
be
a
reassurance
to
all
our
neighbours
that
a
stable
Afghanistan
,
a
peaceful
Afghanistan
is
good
for
all
.
Nobody
should
feel
a
looser
in
Afghanistan
,
â€™â€™
President
Hamid
Karzai
told
Pakistan
â€™s
English
daily
The
Nation
.
All
the
regional
countries
have
publicly
backed
the
Karzai
government
and
supported
the
electoral
process
,
but
serious
undercurrents
remain
as
they
all
have
their
favourite
contenders
in
Afghanistan
.
Since
September
11
,
Pakistan
has
been
repeatedly
accused
by
Afghan
and
Western
leaders
of
harbouring
Taliban
extremists
who
had
pledged
to
disrupt
the
elections
,
but
at
the
highest
level
the
US
has
avoided
criticising
President
Pervaiz
Musharraf
on
the
grounds
that
he
is
helping
the
US
catch
Al
Qaeda
elements
inside
Pakistan
.
That
changed
on
September
22
when
President
George
W.
Bush
,
Musharraf
and
Karzai
held
a
three
way
meeting
in
New
York
on
the
sidelines
of
the
UN
General
Assembly
.
The
meeting
was
pushed
together
by
the
CIA
and
the
US
Defence
Department
who
were
desperately
anxious
to
secure
a
peaceful
election
in
Afghanistan
and
the
non-interference
of
alleged
Pakistani
backed
Taliban
.
Western
and
Afghan
diplomats
intimately
involved
with
the
meeting
,
said
Bush
pushed
Musharraf
hard
on
reigning
in
the
Taliban
so
the
elections
could
take
place
peacefully
.
â€˜â€™
Where
are
Mullah
Omar
,
Mullah
Usmani
and
Gulbuddin
Hikmetar
?
â€™â€™
Bush
is
reported
to
have
asked
a
flustered
Musharraf
.
All
three
are
extremist
Taliban
or
their
allies
and
known
to
be
living
in
Pakistan
.
(
Mullah
Omar
is
leader
of
the
Taliban
,
Usmani
is
the
former
corps
commander
of
Kandahar
under
the
Taliban
regime
and
now
a
commander
of
Taliban
forces
while
Hikmetyar
heads
the
extremist
Hizb
-
e
-
Islami
.
)
â€˜â€™
It
was
the
first
time
that
Bush
totally
focused
on
the
Taliban
threat
rather
than
Al
Qaeda
with
the
Pakistanis
,
â€™â€™
says
a
Western
diplomat
.
â€˜â€™
Bush
was
very
well
briefed
before
the
meeting
,
â€™â€™
the
diplomat
said
.
An
Afghan
official
at
the
meeting
added
,
â€˜â€™
The
Americans
now
realise
that
the
Taliban
are
a
bigger
threat
to
our
security
than
Al
Qaeda
.
â€™â€™
Karzai
was
clearly
pleased
at
the
results
.
â€˜â€™
President
Musharraf
promised
to
help
us
and
cooperate
with
us
on
curbing
terrorist
activity
by
the
Taliban
,
â€™â€™
says
Karzai
.
The
next
day
an
angry
Musharraf
categorically
said
that
Pakistan
would
not
send
Pakistani
troops
to
Iraq
,
a
clear
snub
to
the
Americans
.
Until
then
he
had
said
Pakistan
â€™s
options
were
open
.
However
Pakistani
officials
insist
that
the
decision
was
unconnected
to
the
tripartite
meeting
.
US
and
NATO
military
officers
in
Kabul
say
it
is
too
early
to
say
whether
Bush
â€™s
tough
message
was
instrumental
in
persuading
Musharraf
and
the
ISI
to
pressure
the
Taliban
to
restrain
from
disrupting
the
elections
.
However
there
were
visible
signs
of
a
crackdown
on
the
Pakistan
side
.
â€˜â€™
Pakistan
now
has
a
large
force
deployed
in
Baluchistan
which
was
not
there
before
,
â€™â€™
says
Lt.
General
David
Barno
.
Also
several
days
before
the
elections
Pakistan
closed
the
border
crossing
point
at
Chaman
in
Baluchistan
which
is
a
key
entry
point
for
the
Taliban
into
Afghanistan
.
At
the
same
time
the
US
remains
oblivious
of
the
serious
problems
and
political
fallout
which
the
army
is
facing
in
its
operations
in
Waziristan
.
Musharraf
has
always
maintained
that
the
US
has
never
provided
actionable
intelligence
about
Taliban
leaders
hiding
in
Baluchistan
.
That
too
may
change
.
US
and
Afghan
intelligence
will
shortly
be
presenting
the
ISI
with
a
list
of
Taliban
extremists
and
their
suspected
whereabouts
.
Moreover
there
are
now
major
covert
attempts
under
way
to
try
and
bring
back
to
Kabul
leading
Taliban
commanders
,
who
have
been
living
quietly
in
Pakistan
and
have
taken
no
part
in
the
Taliban
insurgency
.
Until
now
Pakistan
has
not
facilitated
such
a
return
and
clearly
it
can
not
happen
until
there
is
both
a
pull
from
Kabul
and
a
push
from
Islamabad
.
With
President
Karzai
certain
to
win
the
elections
and
the
demotion
of
key
former
Northern
Alliance
figures
such
as
General
Fahim
and
warlord
Ismail
Khan
,
there
is
now
little
reason
for
moderate
Taliban
leaders
to
fear
reprisals
from
former
Northern
Alliance
figures
if
they
return
home
.
Their
removal
should
also
provide
increased
motivation
for
Pakistan
to
help
the
return
of
moderate
Taliban
.
Afghan
officials
welcomed
the
appointment
on
October
3
of
Lt.
General
Ashfaq
Kiyani
as
the
new
ISI
chief
.
Karzai
also
has
to
deal
with
the
stepped
up
rivalry
between
India
and
Pakistan
in
Afghanistan
.
Islamabad
accuses
New
Delhi
of
using
its
consulates
in
Kandahar
and
Jalalabad
to
train
Balochi
insurgents
who
are
active
in
Pakistani
Balochistan
.
Pakistani
officials
claim
there
are
as
many
as
42
RAW
agents
based
in
Kandahar
and
another
12
in
Jalalabad
.
â€œ
There
have
no
business
being
there
unless
they
are
undermining
Pakistan
,
â€™â€™
says
a
Pakistani
official
.
Both
India
and
Afghanistan
deny
the
claim
.
â€˜â€™
Should
Pakistan
show
us
any
evidence
of
an
Indian
hand
using
Afghan
soil
to
work
against
our
neighbours
we
will
take
it
very
seriously
,
â€
says
Amrullah
Saleh
the
head
of
Afghanistan
â€™s
National
Security
Directorate
.
Karzai
categorically
said
that
he
has
assured
Musharraf
repeatedly
that
any
adverse
action
against
Pakistan
taken
by
Indian
diplomats
inside
Afghanistan
would
be
acted
upon
swiftly
.
Senior
US
diplomats
and
military
officials
have
warned
India
also
.
In
a
major
regional
shift
reflecting
the
newly
strengthened
position
of
Karzai
,
Iran
,
Russia
and
India
which
have
traditionally
backed
the
Tajik
dominated
former
Northern
Alliance
made
strenuous
efforts
to
convince
presidential
candidate
Younis
Qanooni
to
strike
a
deal
with
Karzai
before
the
elections
and
not
to
oppose
Karzai
.
Iran
in
particular
feared
that
Qanooni
would
loose
and
then
be
politically
isolated
from
the
mainstream
.
Qanooni
refused
to
accept
the
Iranian
advice
as
his
fellow
Panjsheri
Tajiks
urged
him
to
stand
against
Karzai
.
However
since
the
elections
Iranian
influence
has
proved
critical
in
convincing
the
Hazara
Shia
candidate
Mohammed
Mohaqeq
to
accept
the
results
of
the
elections
and
later
convincing
Qanooni
to
do
the
same
.
With
the
US
military
presence
posing
a
threat
on
their
borders
in
both
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
,
Iran
â€™s
moderate
leadership
is
keen
to
help
stabilise
Karzai
so
that
the
US
presence
in
Afghanistan
is
reduced
.
However
powerful
hardliners
in
Tehran
may
be
trying
to
undermine
that
strategy
and
a
new
issue
is
likely
to
deepen
the
rift
with
the
moderates
.
Iranian
officials
are
deeply
concerned
about
the
US
occupation
of
Shindand
,
a
massive
Soviet
-
era
airbase
just
30
kilometres
from
Iran
â€™s
border
.
The
enhanced
US
presence
in
western
Afghanistan
was
only
made
possible
after
the
ousting
of
Ismail
Khan
,
the
warlord
and
Governor
of
Herat
province
last
month
,
who
was
a
close
ally
of
Iranian
hardliners
.
Iranian
officials
say
they
made
no
objections
to
Khan
â€™s
ouster
because
they
want
to
strengthen
Karzai
â€™s
campaign
against
warlords
.
Afghan
officials
say
the
Americans
have
moved
over
100
Special
Forces
and
helicopters
to
Shindand
.
However
General
Barno
insists
the
US
presence
poses
no
threat
to
Iran
.
â€˜â€™
We
have
a
very
small
number
of
forces
in
Shindand
with
a
few
helicopters
,
â€™â€™
says
Barno
.
Nevertheless
this
places
Karzai
in
a
difficult
and
sensitive
situation
because
he
has
to
maintain
excellent
relations
with
both
the
US
and
Iran
.
â€˜â€™
Afghanistan
has
had
the
benefit
of
cooperation
from
both
the
US
and
Iran
.
So
far
what
they
have
done
together
has
been
good
for
us
and
that
â€™s
how
we
would
like
to
keep
it
â€™â€™
,
says
Karzai
.
Nobody
can
claim
that
the
interference
of
Afghanistan
â€™s
neighbours
is
over
,
but
the
elections
will
do
much
to
strengthen
Karzai
and
deal
more
firmly
with
neighbours
â€™
interference
.
In
the
post
election
scenario
it
is
becoming
abundantly
clear
that
the
Taliban
do
not
have
the
support
of
the
Afghan
people
nor
the
Afghan
Pashtuns
.
In
a
highly
significant
move
Afghan
Pashtun
tribes
along
the
Pakistan
border
warned
the
Taliban
in
Quetta
and
Chaman
that
if
they
try
and
disrupt
the
elections
,
they
would
be
resisted
.
Many
Taliban
living
in
Afghanistan
voted
for
President
Karzai
.
It
is
now
abundantly
clear
that
with
the
rapidly
changing
face
of
Afghanistan
,
the
demise
of
key
Northern
Alliance
figures
and
the
fluid
political
situation
in
Afghanistan
,
Pakistan
should
reconsider
its
policy
of
giving
unlimited
sanctuary
to
Taliban
extremists
living
on
Pakistani
soil
.

The
charges
that
they
have
put
some
vets
up
to
making
against
Kerry
are
false
and
can
be
demonstrated
by
the
historical
record
to
be
false
.
Most
of
those
making
the
charges
have
even
flip
-
flopped
,
contradicting
themselves
.
Or
they
were
n't
eyewitnesses
and
are
just
lying
.
But
to
address
the
substance
of
this
Big
Lie
is
to
risk
falling
into
its
logic
.
The
true
absurdity
of
the
entire
situation
is
easily
appreciated
when
we
consider
that
George
W.
Bush
never
showed
any
bravery
at
all
at
any
point
in
his
life
.
He
has
never
lived
in
a
war
zone
.
If
some
of
John
Kerry
's
wounds
were
superficial
,
Bush
received
no
wounds
.
(
And
,
a
piece
of
shrapnel
in
the
forearm
that
caused
only
a
minor
wound
would
have
killed
had
it
hit
an
eye
and
gone
into
the
brain
;
the
shrapnel
being
in
your
body
demonstrates
you
were
in
mortal
danger
and
did
n't
absent
yourself
from
it
.
That
is
the
logic
of
the
medal
)
.
Kerry
saved
a
man
's
life
while
under
fire
.
Bush
did
no
such
thing
.
What
was
Bush
doing
with
his
youth
?
He
was
drinking
.
For
decades
.
He
gave
no
service
to
anyone
,
risked
nothing
,
and
did
not
even
slack
off
efficiently
.
The
history
of
alcoholism
and
possibly
other
drug
use
is
a
key
issue
because
it
not
only
speaks
to
Bush
's
character
as
an
addictive
personality
,
but
may
tell
us
something
about
his
erratic
and
alarming
actions
as
president
.
(
Newsweek
reported
that
Bush
commanded
his
cabinet
,
"
Let
heads
roll
!
"
)
That
temper
is
only
one
problem
.
Bush
has
a
sadistic
streak
.
He
clearly
enjoyed
,
as
governor
,
watching
executions
.
His
delight
in
killing
people
became
a
campaign
issue
in
2000
when
he
seemed
,
in
one
debate
,
to
enjoy
the
prospect
of
executing
wrong
-
doers
a
little
too
much
.
He
has
clearly
gone
on
enjoying
killing
people
on
a
large
scale
in
Iraq
.
Two
decades
of
pickling
his
nervous
system
in
various
highly
toxic
substances
have
left
Bush
damaged
goods
.
Even
for
those
who
later
abstain
,
"
visual
-
spatial
abilities
,
abstraction
,
problem
solving
,
and
short
-
term
memory
,
are
the
slowest
to
recover
.
"
That
he
managed
to
get
on
the
wagon
(
though
with
that
pretzel
incident
,
you
wonder
how
firmly
)
is
laudable
.
But
he
suffers
the
severe
effects
of
the
aftermath
,
and
we
are
all
suffering
along
with
him
now
,
since
he
is
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
.
We
all
know
by
now
that
Bush
did
not
even
do
his
full
service
with
the
Texas
Air
National
Guard
,
absenting
himself
to
work
on
the
Alabama
senate
campaign
of
Winton
"
Red
"
Blount
.
Whether
he
was
actually
AWOL
during
this
stint
is
unclear
.
But
it
is
clear
that
not
only
did
Bush
slack
off
on
his
National
Guard
service
,
but
he
slacked
off
from
his
campaign
work
.
For
weeks
,
reporters
scoured
Alabama
in
search
of
pilots
or
anyone
who
might
have
remembered
seeing
Mr.
Bush
at
the
time
he
was
serving
in
the
National
Guard
there
.
There
is
one
place
in
Alabama
where
Mr.
Bush
was
present
nearly
every
day
:
the
headquarters
in
Montgomery
of
US
Senate
candidate
Winton
"
Red
"
Blount
.
President
Bush
has
always
said
that
working
for
Blount
was
the
reason
he
transferred
to
the
Alabama
Air
National
Guard
.
NPR
's
Wade
Goodwyn
has
this
report
about
Mr.
Bush
's
time
on
that
campaign
.
WADE
GOODWYN
reporting
:
In
1972
,
Baba
Groom
was
a
smart
,
funny
young
woman
smack
-
dab
in
the
middle
of
an
exciting
US
Senate
campaign
.
Groom
was
Republican
Red
Blount
's
scheduler
,
and
in
that
job
,
she
was
the
hub
in
the
campaign
wheel
.
Ask
her
about
the
handsome
young
man
from
Texas
,
and
she
remembers
him
32
years
later
like
it
was
yesterday
.
Ms.
BABA
GROOM
(
Former
Campaign
Worker
)
:
He
would
wear
khaki
trousers
and
some
old
jacket
.
He
was
always
ready
to
go
out
on
the
road
.
On
the
phone
,
you
could
hear
his
accent
.
It
was
a
Texas
accent
.
But
he
just
melded
with
everybody
.
GOODWYN
:
The
candidate
Mr.
Bush
was
working
for
,
Red
Blount
,
had
gotten
rich
in
Alabama
in
the
construction
business
.
Blount
's
support
of
the
party
led
him
to
be
appointed
Richard
Nixon
's
postmaster
general
.
In
Washington
,
Blount
became
friends
and
tennis
partners
with
Mr.
Bush
's
father
,
then
Congressman
Bush
.
That
was
how
26
-
year
-
old
Lieutenant
Bush
came
to
Montgomery
,
at
his
father
's
urging
.
.
.
It
was
the
young
Texan
's
job
to
find
out
what
each
county
leader
needed
in
the
way
of
campaign
supplies
and
get
those
supplies
to
them
.
Groom
says
this
job
helped
Mr.
Bush
understand
how
even
in
a
statewide
Senate
campaign
,
politics
are
local
.
.
.
.
Murph
Archibald
is
Red
Blount
's
nephew
by
marriage
,
and
in
1972
,
he
was
coming
off
a
15
-
month
tour
in
Vietnam
in
the
infantry
.
Archibald
says
that
in
a
campaign
full
of
dedicated
workers
,
Mr.
Bush
was
not
one
of
them
.
Ordinarily
,
George
would
come
in
around
noon
;
he
would
ordinarily
leave
around
5:30
or
6:00
in
the
evening
.
Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
George
certainly
did
n't
seem
to
have
any
concerns
about
my
taking
over
this
work
with
the
campaign
workers
there
.
My
overall
impression
was
that
he
did
n't
seem
as
interested
in
the
campaign
as
the
other
people
who
were
working
at
the
state
headquarters
.
GOODWYN
:
Murph
Archibald
says
that
at
first
,
he
did
n't
know
that
Mr.
Bush
was
serving
in
the
Air
National
Guard
.
After
he
found
out
from
somebody
else
,
Archibald
attempted
to
talk
to
Mr.
Bush
about
it
.
The
president
was
a
lieutenant
and
Archibald
had
been
a
lieutenant
,
too
;
he
figured
they
had
something
to
talk
about
.
Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
George
did
n't
have
any
interest
at
all
in
talking
about
the
military
.
In
fact
,
when
I
broached
the
subject
with
him
,
he
simply
changed
the
subject
.
He
was
n't
unpleasant
about
it
,
but
he
just
changed
the
subject
and
would
n't
talk
about
it
.
GOODWYN
:
Far
from
Texas
and
Washington
,
DC
,
Mr.
Bush
enjoyed
his
freedom
.
He
dated
a
beautiful
young
woman
working
on
the
campaign
.
In
fact
,
he
left
the
house
he
rented
in
such
disrepair
--
with
damage
to
the
walls
and
a
chandelier
destroyed
--
that
the
Montgomery
family
who
owned
it
still
grumble
about
the
unpaid
repair
bill
.
Archibald
says
Mr.
Bush
would
come
into
the
office
and
,
in
a
friendly
way
,
offer
up
stories
about
the
drinking
he
'd
done
the
night
before
,
kind
of
as
a
conversation
starter
.
Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
People
have
different
ways
of
starting
the
days
in
any
office
.
They
're
going
to
talk
about
their
kids
,
they
're
going
to
talk
about
football
,
they
're
going
to
talk
about
the
weather
.
And
this
was
simply
his
opening
gambit
;
he
would
start
talking
about
that
he
had
been
out
late
the
night
before
drinking
.
GOODWYN
:
Archibald
says
the
frequency
with
which
Mr.
Bush
discussed
the
subject
was
off
-
putting
to
him
.
Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
I
mean
,
at
that
time
,
I
was
28
;
George
would
have
been
25
or
26
.
I
thought
it
unusual
and
,
frankly
,
inappropriate
.
GOODWYN
:
According
to
Archibald
,
Mr.
Bush
would
also
sometimes
tell
stories
about
his
days
at
Yale
in
New
Haven
,
and
how
whenever
he
got
pulled
over
for
erratic
driving
,
he
was
let
go
after
the
officers
discovered
he
was
the
grandson
of
a
Connecticut
US
senator
.
Archibald
,
a
middle
-
class
Alabama
boy
--
who
,
by
the
way
,
is
now
a
registered
Democrat
--
did
n't
like
that
story
.
Mr.
ARCHIBALD
:
He
told
us
whenever
he
was
stopped
,
as
soon
as
the
law
enforcement
found
out
that
he
was
the
grandson
of
Prescott
Bush
,
they
would
let
him
go
.
And
he
would
always
laugh
about
that
.
"
Goodwyn
dutifully
notes
that
Baba
Groom
did
n't
remember
George
telling
drunk
stories
.
But
that
means
nothing
,
since
they
were
n't
the
sort
of
things
guys
like
Bush
told
the
"
girls
"
.
He
was
trying
to
buddy
with
Archibald
and
impress
him
.
Again
,
decades
of
this
sort
of
behavior
do
not
leave
a
person
untouched
.
Our
world
is
in
crisis
and
our
Republic
is
in
danger
.
It
should
not
be
left
in
the
hands
of
a
man
who
spent
his
life
like
this
.
Just
remember
that
death
is
not
the
end
And
you
search
in
vain
to
find
just
one
law
abiding
citizen
Just
remember
that
death
is
not
the
end

Afraid
I
do
n't
have
time
today
to
discuss
these
,
but
some
stories
need
attention
:
(
also
see
this
thread
on
the
RI
discussion
board
)
:
Some
200,000
guns
the
US
sent
to
Iraqi
security
forces
may
have
been
smuggled
to
terrorists
,
it
was
feared
yesterday
.
But
the
four
planeloads
of
arms
have
vanished
.
Orders
for
the
deal
to
go
ahead
were
given
by
the
US
Department
of
Defense
.
But
the
work
was
contracted
out
via
a
complex
web
of
private
arms
traders
.
And
the
Moldovan
airline
used
to
transport
the
shipment
was
blasted
by
the
UN
in
2003
for
smuggling
arms
to
Liberia
,
human
rights
group
Amnesty
has
discovered
.
Amnesty
chief
spokesman
Mike
Blakemore
said
:
"
It
's
unbelievable
that
no
one
can
account
for
200,000
assault
rifles
.
If
these
weapons
have
gone
missing
it
's
a
terrifying
prospect
.
"
But
air
traffic
controllers
in
Baghdad
have
no
record
of
the
flights
,
which
supposedly
took
off
between
July
2004
and
July
2005
.
A
coalition
forces
spokesman
confirmed
they
had
not
received
"
any
weapons
from
Bosnia
"
and
added
they
were
"
not
aware
of
any
purchases
for
Iraq
from
Bosnia
"
.
Nato
and
US
officials
have
already
voiced
fears
that
Bosnian
arms
-
sold
by
US
,
British
and
Swiss
firms
-
are
being
passed
to
insurgents
.
A
NATO
spokesman
said
:
"
There
's
no
tracking
mechanism
to
ensure
they
do
n't
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
.
There
are
concerns
that
some
may
have
been
siphoned
off
.
"
The
Moldovan
airline
is
Aerocom
,
and
yes
,
it
's
one
of
Victor
Bout
's
.
It
's
always
a
bang
-
your
-
head
-
against
-
the
-
wall
moment
,
reading
again
the
play
the
incompetence
theory
receives
,
even
from
some
of
the
Administration
's
harshest
mainstream
critics
.
But
Bout
's
name
is
n't
likely
to
be
mentioned
in
whatever
coverage
this
story
receives
,
before
it
sinks
like
so
many
others
beneath
the
media
's
frothing
triviality
.
Meanwhile
,
a
decision
's
been
reached
in
the
trial
of
Toledo
priest
Gerald
Robinson
.
And
it
's
guilty
:
The
Rev.
Gerald
Robinson
appeared
stony
-
faced
as
the
jury
's
guilty
verdict
was
read
,
and
he
blinked
repeatedly
and
glanced
at
his
lawyers
before
being
led
away
in
handcuffs
.
...
The
crime
occurred
in
the
sacristy
adjoining
the
hospital
chapel
in
downtown
Toledo
on
the
Saturday
before
Easter
in
1980
.
Investigators
said
the
nun
,
Margaret
Ann
Pahl
,
71
,
was
strangled
and
then
stabbed
,
with
nine
wounds
on
her
chest
forming
the
shape
of
an
inverted
cross
,
a
well
-
recognized
Satanic
symbol
.
An
altar
cloth
was
draped
over
her
half
-
naked
body
,
which
was
posed
as
if
she
had
been
sexually
assaulted
.
It
was
about
how
he
could
humiliate
her
the
most
,
prosecutor
Dean
Mandros
said
in
closing
arguments
.
He
left
a
message
for
everyone
to
see
...
maybe
to
God
himself
.
From
SNAP
's
statement
on
the
Robinson
conviction
:
When
victims
and
witnesses
stay
silent
,
nothing
changes
.
When
victims
and
witnesses
speak
up
,
at
least
sometimes
a
child
is
protected
,
the
truth
is
exposed
,
and
justice
is
done
.
The
murder
weapon
,
Robinson
's

opener
:
Finally
,
from
an
email
,
a
follow
-
up
on
the
reopening
of
the
investigation
into
the
Atlanta
Child
Murders
:
Dekalb
County
Police
Chief
Louis
Graham
...
the
man
who
reopened
the
investigations
last
year
,
is
mysteriously
stepping
down
.
And
of
all
the
people
who
the
county
is
getting
to
find
a
replacement
...
is
none
other
than
Lee
Brown
,
the
original
supervisor
of
the
Atlanta
PD
,
who
was
in
office
during
the
murders
and
the
subsequent
investigation
.
SNAP
is
right
in
part
.
The
will
is
another
matter
.
Some
do
,
individually
.
But
institutionally
?
That
's
still
the
domain
of
those

CRACKDOWN
ON
POLYGAMY
GROUP
...
...
At
weekend
press
conferences
in
Salt
Lake
City
and
Phoenix
,
FBI
and
state
officials
said
Jeffs
"
is
considered
armed
and
dangerous
and
may
be
traveling
with
armed
bodyguards
.
"
In
the
past
,
he
has
talked
in
apocalyptic
terms
about
a
violent
end
to
the
world
,
according
to
former
members
.
...
The
black
race
is
the
people
through
which
the
devil
has
always
been
able
to
bring
evil
unto

,
Jeffs
has
said
as
cited
by
the
Southern
Poverty
Law
Center
's
"
Intelligence
Report
.
"
An
editorial
in
the
church
-
owned
Deseret
Morning
News
in
Salt
Lake
City
earlier
this
year
acknowledged
that
"
the
state
's
history
,
a
conservative
belief
in
free
choice
,
and
an
unwillingness
to
stir
up
a
hornet
's
nest
in
the
national
media
have
likely
all
contributed
to
the
kid
-
glove
approach
lawmakers
and
law
-
enforcement
officers
have
taken
when
dealing
with
polygamous
communities
.
"
There
's
no
tracking
mechanism
in
place
?!?!?
Never
mind
.
No
need
to
worry
.
I
'm
sure
this
kind
of
thing
goes
on
all
the
time
.
We
now
return
you
to
your
regularly
scheduled
programming
....
just
go
here
,
it
s
simply
amazing
The
Raw
Story
i
count
like
14
explosive
headlines
.
Then
,
of
course
,
there
is
the
evidence
the
jury
did
not
hear
about
in
the
Robinson
case
...
Maybe
because
they
hint
at
a
larger
conspiracy
/
network
of
abusers
/
satanic
underground
?
I
read
of
a
case
not
long
ago
when
some
people
were
trying
to
get
a
polygamous
judge
taken
off
the
bench
for
not
obeying
state
law
.
Of
course
law
enforcement
has
dragged
it's
feet
when
members
are
taking
part
in
the
activity
themselves
.
Personally
I
do
n't
give
a
damn
what
adults
do
to
one
another
as
long
as
there
is
no
abuse
invovled
.
In
the
Warren
Jeffs
cult
he
reassigns
wives
if
the
husband
displeases
him
or
to
reward
the
new
husband
.
Husbands
marry
mothers
and
teen
daughters
at
the
same
time
.
a
rare
form
of
retardation
is
showing
up
in
that
group
more
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
.
It
is
genetic
and
the
child
needs
to
get
the
gene
from
both
parents
to
turn
into
a
vegetable
instead
of
a
thinking
child
.
The
doctor
begs
them
to
stop
intermarrying
but
they
say
they
have
to
keep
the

pure
.
look
up
fumarase
deficiency
for
more
info
.
Also
look
up
the
kingston
family
.
One
member
actually
was
convicted
of
beating
his
teen
daughter
unconcious
when
she
ran
away
from
'
marriage
'
to
her
father
's
own
brother
.
no
one
was
charged
for
forced
marriage
,
only
the
beating
.
So
we
"
lost
"
some
weapon
?
It
's
a
good
thing
too
.
We
would
n't
want
those
terrorists
to
run
out
of
shit
to
shoot
at
us
.
Then
the
war
might
stop
&
all
those
juicy
profits
would
just
evaporate
.
What
's
a
few
dead
soldiers
in
comparison
to
keeping
all
those
defense
contractors
awash
in
all
that
tax
cash
?
They
really
are
milking
the
incompetence
angle
though
,
are
n't
they
?
Just
another
big
Iraq
whoopsie
daisy

huh

is
itself
unquestionably
a
cult
:
As
the
leaders
like
to
boast
,
the
Mujahedeen
is
a
family
affair
.
(
''
We
have
three
generations
of
martyrs
:
grandmothers
,
mothers
,
daughters
.
''
)
Most
of
the
girls
I
was
meeting
had
grown
up
in
Mujahedeen
schools
in
Ashraf
,
where
they
lived
separated
from
their
parents
.
Family
visits
were
allowed
on
Thursday
nights
and
Fridays
.
When
they
were
18
or
19
,
many
of
them
decided
to
come
back
to
Iraq
and
fill
the
ranks
of
the
youngest
Mujahedeen
generation
.
Though
''
decided
''
is
probably
not
the
right
word
,
since
from
the
day
they
were
born
,
these
girls
and
boys
were
not
taught
to
think
for
themselves
but
to
blindly
follow
their
leaders
.

Which
may
explain
the
pattern

a
journey
to
self

inspired
by
the
light

Irony

Long

That
's
it

I
'm
firing
my
editor
.
Well
,
it
's
not
as
simple
and
clear
cut
as
all
that
.
We
're
entering
into
some
interesting
and
perhaps
previously
unexplored
socio-political
-
spiritual
territory
here
that
may
require
further
examination
and
serious
introspection
.
The
Kevin
Coogan
publication
posted
on
the
previous
thread
might
serve
as
a
good
launching
point
for
further
discussion
.
The
following
quote
is
from
that
Coogan
article
:
Imaginary
evil
is
romantic
and
varied
;
real
evil
is
gloomy
,
monotonous
,
barren
,
boring
.
Imaginary
good
is
boring
;
real
good
is
always
new
,
marvelous
,
intoxicating
.

Simone
Weil
Starroute
:
I
would
n't
wonder
too
hard
.
The
answer
is
likely
D
:
all
of
the
above
,
due
to
this
being
a
complex
reality
we
live
in
.
But
to
me
,
without
question
,
they
often
know
perfectly
well
.
Here
is
a
thought
:
When
the
appartently
cognitively
functional
take
actions
that
seem
senseless
and
incompetent
,
it
is
a
most
certain
sign
that
they
have
ulterior
or
hidden
motives
.
They
trust
you
and
me
to
be
befuddled
by
their
actions
,
while
they
"
do
as
they
wilt
"
.
To
not
buying
the
BS
&
here
I
am
thinking
that
I
really
must
be
getting
old
.
Since
the
article
was
specifically
about
"
death
metal
"
I
guess
the
author
missed
this
little
tidbit
or
we
just
have
waaaaaaaaaaaaay
different
definitions
of
morality
:
One
man
's
relentless
search
for
his
missing
son
led
him
to
uncover
one
of
the
most
shocking
crimes
in
post-war
Italy
-
a
tale
of
satanism
and
violence
that
has
gripped
the
country
for
more
than
a
year
.
In
January
1998
Fabio
Tollis
and
Chiara
Marino
,
both
just
16
,
disappeared
.
They
had
been
drinking
at
a
pub
called
the
Midnight
-
the
centre
of
the
heavy
metal
scene
in
Milan
-
and
they
never
came
home
.
The
police
and
many
of
their
friends
just
thought
they
had
run
off
together
.
But
their
parents
refused
to
accept
this
.
Michele
Tollis
,
Fabio
's
father
,
began
to
attend
metal
concerts
and
festivals
across
Europe
,
handing
out
leaflets
and
quizzing
Fabio
's
friends
.
Fabio
and
his
friends
were
into
the
most
extreme
forms
of
heavy
metal
music
-
death
metal
and
black
metal
,
music
obsessed
with
images
of
murder
and
satanism
-
and
the
role
of
this
music
is
central
to
the
story
.
No
one
can
contradict
me
when
I
say
that
heavy
metal
and
satanism
are
closely
linked
Michele
Tollis
It
emerged
that
Chiara
,
the
girl
who
disappeared
with
Fabio
,
had
a
collection
of
satanic
literature
and
paraphernalia
in
her
bedroom
.
During
this
search
,
Michele
Tollis
became
convinced
that
satanism
had
something
to
do
with
his
son
's
disappearance
.
No
one
can
contradict
me
when
I
say
that
heavy
metal
and
satanism
are
closely
linked
.
No
one
can
contradict
me
when
I

that
heave

metal
and
Satan

are
close

.
They
're
inseparable
,
"
he
says
.
Yeah
,
I
think
Jeff
wrote
on
one
of
his
posts
here
in
the
past
several
months
:
"
To
hell
with
death
"
.
I
wholly
agree
,
and
would
expand
that
statement
to
include
:
"
To
hell
with
death
metal
"
.
The
freaky
thing
here
is
that
these
bozos
are
seriously
claiming
the
moral
high
ground
?
?
?
?
?
Talk
about
a
beat
-
your
-
head
-
against
-
the
-
wall
moment
!
And
for
'
Smartwolf
'
above
,
think
about
the
inversion
principle
being
employed
.
They
are
doing
it
deliberately
.
Do
you
really
think
GWB
,
and
neocons
in
general
are
representative
of
true
followers
of
Jesus
of
Nazareth
?
(
I
know
,
ignorant
question
)
Then
why
call
them
,
or
any
other
phonies
'
Christians
'
,
even
if
they
themselves
claim
the
appellation
.
They
are
merely
imposters
.
Everything
they
claim
is
a
lie
,
and
this
above
all
.
So
why
even
credit
their
claims
?
This
only
serves
their
purposes
.
They
want
to
be
identified
as
'
Christians
'
,
and
I
fully
suspect
that
for
some
of
them
,
the
motivation
behind
their
subterfuge
is
more
than
mere
political
advantage
,
and
has
a
lot
more
to
do
with
the
black
magician
's
practice
of
the
inversion
principle
.
We
need
to
be
more
'
rigorous
'
about
how
we
perceive
these
people
.
See
them
as
they
are
,
not
for
what
they
claim
to
be
.
...
the
most
extreme
forms
of
heavy

music
-
death

and

,
music
obsessed
with
images
of
murder
and

-
and
the
role
of
this

is

to
the

Adolf
Hitler
even
held
an
exhibition
of
'
degenerate
art
'
in
1937
,
while
curating
a
parallel
show
of
'
Aryan
'
art
across
the
street
.
The
German
Expressionist
movement
was
destroyed
as
a
result
.
Here
's
a
quick
overview
of
the
Entartete
Kunst
(
Degenerate
Art
)
exhibit
of
1937
:
Nordau
was
also
the
co
founder
of
the

Organization

When
the
apparently
cognitively
functional
take
actions
that
seem
senseless

incompetent
,
it
is
a
most

sign
that
they
have
ulterior
or

They

and
me

while

"

"
A
question
:
Are
the
adherent
of
'
Crowleyan
Thelema
'
and
others
of
similar
ilk
appropriating
or
appropriating
from
the
appropriators
to
redirect
'
energy
?
'
Does
this
reappropriation
lead
to
or
originate
from
the
same
place
?
Seems
as
if
there
is
a
clear
distinction
being
made
between
the
'
imaginary
'
Whore
of
Babalon
and
the
actually
Whore
of
Babylon
,
which
is
this
global
system
.
Is
the
distinction
accurate
and
valid
?
Does
the
distinction
actually
exist
?
This
is
where
the
socio
-
political
aspect
of
this
conundrum
comes
into
play
.
Confused
?
Good
.
so
,
enemy
,
what
's
your
point
?
Why
do
n't
you
state
it
?
My
point
is
that
these
are
all
just
questions
and
I
am
undecided
as
to
the
answers
.
Here
's
another
interesting
example
:
John
Balance
from
Coil
.
Balance
died
in
2004
after
a
'
fall
.
'
He
blended
belief
systems
such
as
Shamanism
,
Christianity
,
Buddhism
,
Paganism
,
Hermeticism
and
Gnosticism
and
imbued
Coil
's
vast
output
with
a
magickal
current
designed
to
have
a
functionally
transcendent
effect
on
listeners
.
Not
200,000
guns
-
the
numbers
do
nt
work
:
5
kg
per
gun
,
200,000
guns
means
1000
tonnes
,
impossible
for
4
containers
.
If
the
load
was
99
tonnes
there
were
probably
less
than
20,000
.
E@tG
:
Maybe
if
you
formulate
your
questions
a
little
more
specifically
it
will
help
you
in
acquiring
the
answers
.
I
am
,
therefore
I
think
:)
Reporting
from
the
town
where
Susan
Polk
's
trial
is
going
on
.
I
went
across
the
bay
last
night
to
attend
a
farmer
's
market
and
music
event
.
Just
give
your
email
and
/
or
phone
number
to
these
guys
and
they
'll
track
down
your
family
.
I
was
amazed
at
the
spiel
they
delivered
.
I
resisted
asking
any
questions
that
would
have
required
either
of
them
to
think
.
It
would
have
been
too
painful
to
watch
.
Has
anyone
read
the
letter
purportedly
from
Ahmadinejad
to
George
Bush
?
I
do
n't
know
if
this
has
been
verified
.
But
succintly
making
point
after
succint
point
,
the
text
of
the
letter
stands
on
its
own
merit
,
regardless
.
I
like
to
imagine
the
thought
processes
going
on
in
W
's
head
if
he
were
to
actually
read
the
letter
,
but
it
is
hard
to
picture
him
actually
reading
this
letter
.
As
I
read
the
letter
,
I
considered
the
vast
contrast
between
mind
and
morality
of
whoever
wrote
it
,
vs.
that
of
the
mind
of
the
man
who
once
said
"

In
scanning
the
whitehouse.gov
site
today
,
I
noticed
the
following
Executive
Order
:
I
ca
n't
believe
there
are
no
serious
metal
fans
who
frequent
RI
.
I
'm
wary
of
jumping
into
this
fray
without
backup
,
that
's
for
damn
sure
.
:)
I
'm
a
regular
poster
but
for
some
reason
blogger
wo
n't
let
me
in
today
...
but
sign
me
TroubleFunk
.
Tronicus
:
Simply
,
the
questions
permeate
the
entire
'
Western
(
Mystery
)
Tradition
'
and
perhaps
'
Eastern
'
as
well
,
as
they
relate
to
the
confluence
of
politics
and
spirituality
.
For
example
,
is
the
system
of
Crowleyan
Thelema
a
failed
alchemical
process
?
Or
was
it
supposed
to
initially
be
a
process
of
alchemical
appropriation
?
Similarly
,
is
invoking
ancient
Egyptian
gods
and
goddesses
a
reaffirmation
of
an
oppressive
and
hierarchical
system
?
In
my
opinion
,
people
can
no
longer
afford
to
partition
out
and
compartmentalize
personal
spiritual
and
political
systems
.
The
'
high
weirdness
'
and
more
hardcore
political
'
factions
'
must
perhaps
integrate
and
arrive
at
a
synthesis
.
In
regards
to
death
metal
,
the
problem
is
,
once
again
,
a
question
of
education
,
history
and
the
vacuous
lack
of
perspective
in
American
culture
.
Baudelaire
was
perhaps
one
of
the
first
'
death
metal
'
artists
.
Tronicus
,
if
you
're
still
checking
this
thread
:
My
real
problem
is
with
literalist
fundamentalists
,
of
any
religion
.
True
believers
are
dangerous
animals
.
I
just
get
hung
up
on
'
Christians
'
,
as
they
're
the
dominant
form
where
I
come
from
.
Also
,
I
'm
quite
clear
on
the
fact
that
those
in
power
now
(
and
,
in
general
,
most
anyone
at
the
top
of
a
pyrimidal
power
structure
)
tend
to
use
the
dominant
religion
as
a
cloak
to
hide
their
true
motivations
and
as
a
tool
to
control
the
masses
.
It
boggles
the
mind
that
ANYONE
can
take
at
face
value
Bush
's
claims
to
be
a
christian
,
yet
many
seem
to
do
just
that
.
I
seem
to
remember
something
about
'
by
their
works
shall
ye
know
them
.
"
I
do
get
my
hackles
up
a
bit
when
people
haul
out
the
old
'
Rock
-
N
-
Roll
made
them
do
it
'
argument
.
Whie
I
do
n't
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
the
things
we
watch
or
listen
to
have
no
effect
on
our
behavior
(
which
I
think
is
patently
rediculous
)
,
it
does
bother
me
when
people
single
out
a
specific
group
of
people
to
pin
the
blame
on
.
Again
,
I
think
the
problem
is
people
who
sink
to
far
into
their
own
egos
,
and
begin
to
take
their
personal
metaphors
a
bit
too
literaly
.
(
The
mixing
of
religion
and
militarism
is
a
whole
other
topic
....
)
I
have
nothing
but
respect
for
people
who
adhear
to
non-violence
,
forgiveness
,
and
charity
,
but
it
's
important
to
remember
that
Christians
(
or
'
Smartwolves
'
)
do
not
have
a
monopoly
on
that
particular
lifestyle
.
Peace
.
The
fact
that
the
US
government
and
media
are
having
a
hissy
fit
over
Venezuela
wanting
to
buy
guns
,
and
then
200,000
of
the
guns
Chavez
wants
to
buy
go
missing
on
their
way
to
Iraq
is
definitely
sus
.
I
guess
those
guns
will
be
located
enroute
to
Venezuela
or
found
in
storage
there
by
one
of
the
US
's
local
stooges
and
they
then
have
a
pretext
to
ramp
the
spin
up
a
notch
or
two
.
Thanks
again
to
my
friend
Nick
Keck
for
passing
this
along
via
e-mail
.
It
is
the
text
of
a
speech
given
by
an
Arab
gentleman
before
the
advisory
board
of
a
large
multi-nation
corporation
.
It
's
a
long
but
very
worthwhile
read
.
A
View
from
the
Eye
of
the
Storm
Talk
delivered
by
Haim
Harari
at
a
meeting
of
the
International
Advisory
Board
of
a
large
multi-national
corporation
,
April
,
2004
:
I
have
never
been
and
I
will
never
be
a
Government
official
and
I
have
no
privileged
information
.
My
perspective
is
entirely
based
on
what
I
see
,
on
what
I
read
and
on
the
fact
that
my
family
has
lived
in
this
region
for
almost
200
years
.
You
may
regard
my
views
as
those
of
the
proverbial
taxi
driver
,
which
you
are
supposed
to
question
,
when
you
visit
a
country
.
However
,
I
will
touch
upon
it
only
in
passing
.
I
prefer
to
devote
most
of
my
remarks
to
the
broader
picture
of
the
region
and
its
place
in
world
events
.
I
refer
to
the
entire
area
between
Pakistan
and
Morocco
,
which
is
predominantly
Arab
,
predominantly
Moslem
,
but
includes
many
non-Arab
and
also
significant
non-Moslem
minorities
.
Why
do
I
put
aside
Israel
and
its
own
immediate
neighborhood
?
Because
Israel
and
any
problems
related
to
it
,
in
spite
of
what
you
might
read
or
hear
in
the
world
media
,
is
not
the
central
issue
,
and
has
never
been
the
central
issue
in
the
upheaval
in
the
region
.
Yes
,
there
is
a
100
year
-
old
Israeli
-
Arab
conflict
,
but
it
is
not
where
the
main
show
is
.
The
mass
murder
happening
right
now
in
Sudan
,
where
the
Arab
Moslem
regime
is
massacring
its
black
Christian
citizens
,
has
nothing
to
do
with
Israel
.
The
frequent
reports
from
Algeria
about
the
murders
of
hundreds
of
civilians
in
one
village
or
another
by
other
Algerians
have
nothing
to
do
with
Israel
.
Saddam
Hussein
did
not
invade
Kuwait
,
endanger
Saudi
Arabia
and
butcher
his
own
people
because
of
Israel
.
The
Taliban
control
of
Afghanistan
and
the
civil
war
there
had
nothing
to
do
with
Israel
.
The
Libyan
blowing
up
of
the
Pan
-
Am
flight
had
nothing
to
do
with
Israel
,
and
I
could
go
on
and
on
and
on
.
The
root
of
the
trouble
is
that
this
entire
Moslem
region
is
totally
dysfunctional
,
by
any
standard
of
the
word
,
and
would
have
been
so
even
if
Israel
had
joined
the
Arab
league
and
an
independent
Palestine
had
existed
for
100
years
.
They
have
a
land
area
larger
than
either
the
US
or
all
of
Europe
.
These
22
countries
,
with
all
their
oil
and
natural
resources
,
have
a
combined
GDP
smaller
than
that
of
Netherlands
plus
Belgium
and
equal
to
half
of
the
GDP
of
California
alone
.
Within
this
meager
GDP
,
the
gaps
between
rich
and
poor
are
beyond
belief
and
too
many
of
the
rich
made
their
money
not
by
succeeding
in
business
,
but
by
being
corrupt
rulers
.
According
to
a
report
prepared
by
a
committee
of
Arab
intellectuals
and
published
under
the
auspices
of
the
U.N.
,
the
number
of
books
translated
by
the
entire
Arab
world
is
much
smaller
than
what
little
Greece
alone
translates
.
The
total
number
of
scientific
publications
of
300
million
Arabs
is
less
than
that
of
6
million
Israelis
.
Birth
rates
in
the
region
are
very
high
,
increasing
the
poverty
,
the
social
gaps
and
the
cultural
decline
.
And
all
of
this
is
happening
in
a
region
,
which
only
30
years
ago
,
was
believed
to
be
the
next
wealthy
part
of
the
world
,
and
in
a
Moslem
area
,
which
developed
,
at
some
point
in
history
,
one
of
the
most
advanced
cultures
in
the
world
.
It
is
fair
to
say
that
this
creates
an
unprecedented
breeding
ground
for
cruel
dictators
,
terror
networks
,
fanaticism
,
incitement
,
suicide
murders
and
general
decline
.
The
problem
is
that
the
vast
silent
majority
of
these
Moslems
are
not
part
of
the
terror
and
the
incitement
,
but
they
also
do
not
stand
up
against
it
.
Many
of
them
can
certainly
tell
right
from
wrong
,
but
are
afraid
to
express
their
views
.
The
events
of
the
last
few
years
have
amplified
four
issues
,
which
have
always
existed
,
but
have
never
been
as
rampant
as
in
the
present
upheaval
in
the
region
.
A
few
more
years
may
pass
before
everybody
acknowledges
that
it
is
a
World
War
,
but
we
are
already
well
into
it
.
These
are
the
four
main
pillars
of
the
current
World
Conflict
,
or
perhaps
we
should
already
refer
to
it
as
"
the
undeclared
World
War
III
"
:
*
1
.
The
first
element
is
the
suicide
murder
.
*
Suicide
murders
are
not
a
new
invention
but
they
have
been
made
popular
,
if
I
may
use
this
expression
,
only
lately
.
Even
after
September
11
,
it
seems
that
most
of
the
Western
World
does
not
yet
understand
this
weapon
.
It
is
a
very
potent
psychological
weapon
.
Its
real
direct
impact
is
relatively
minor
.
September
11
was
quantitatively
much
less
lethal
than
many
earthquakes
Saddam
killed
every
month
more
people
than
all
those
who
died
from
suicide
murders
since
the
Coalition
occupation
of
Iraq
.
So
what
is
all
the
fuss
about
suicide
killings
?
It
creates
headlines
.
It
is
spectacular
.
It
is
frightening
.
It
is
a
very
cruel
death
with
bodies
dismembered
and
horrible
severe
lifelong
injuries
to
many
of
the
wounded
.
It
is
always
shown
on
television
in
great
detail
.
One
such
murder
,
with
the
help
of
hysterical
media
coverage
,
can
destroy
the
tourism
industry
of
a
country
for
quite
a
while
,
as
it
did
in
Bali
and
in
Turkey
.
But
the
real
fear
comes
from
the
undisputed
fact
that
no
defense
and
no
preventive
measures
can
succeed
against
a
determined
suicide
murderer
.
This
has
not
yet
penetrated
the
thinking
of
the
Western
World
.
The
U.S.
and
Europe
are
constantly
improving
their
defense
against
the
last
murder
,
not
the
next
one
.
But
if
you
want
to
murder
by
suicide
,
you
do
not
have
to
board
a
plane
in
order
to
explode
yourself
and
kill
many
people
.
Who
could
stop
a
suicide
murder
in
the
midst
of
the
crowded
line
waiting
to
be
checked
by
the
airport
metal
detector
?
How
about
the
lines
to
the
check
-
in
counters
in
a
busy
travel
period
?
Put
a
metal
detector
in
front
of
every
train
station
in
Spain
and
the
terrorists
will
get
the
buses
.
Protect
the
buses
and
they
will
explode
in
movie
theaters
,
concert
halls
,
supermarkets
,
shopping
malls
,
schools
and
hospitals
.
Put
guards
in
front
of
every
concert
hall
and
there
will
always
be
a
line
of
people
to
be
checked
by
the
guards
and
this
line
will
be
the
target
,
not
to
speak
of
killing
the
guards
themselves
.
You
can
somewhat
reduce
your
vulnerability
by
preventive
and
defensive
measures
and
by
strict
border
controls
but
not
eliminate
it
and
definitely
not
win
the
war
in
a
defensive
way
.
And
it
is
a
war
!
What
is
behind
the
suicide
murders
?
Money
is
,
money
and
power
and
cold
-
blooded
murderous
incitement
,
nothing
else
.
No
Moslem
preacher
has
ever
blown
himself
up
.
No
son
of
an
Arab
politician
or
religious
leader
has
ever
blown
himself
up
.
No
relative
of
anyone
influential
has
done
it
.
Would
n't
you
expect
some
of
the
religious
leaders
to
do
it
themselves
,
or
to
talk
their
sons
into
doing
it
,
if
this
is
truly
a
supreme
act
of
religious
fervor
?
Are
n't
they
interested
in
the
benefits
of
going
to
Heaven
?
They
promise
them
the
delights
,
mostly
sexual
,
of
the
next
world
,
and
pay
their
families
handsomely
after
the
supreme
act
is
performed
and
enough
innocent
people
are
dead
.
Suicide
murders
also
have
nothing
to
do
with
poverty
and
despair
.
The
poorest
region
in
the
world
,
by
far
,
is
Africa
.
It
never
happens
there
.
There
are
numerous
desperate
people
in
the
world
,
in
different
cultures
,
countries
and
continents
.
Desperation
does
not
provide
anyone
with
explosives
,
reconnaissance
and
transportation
.
There
was
certainly
more
despair
in
Saddam
's
Iraq
than
in
Paul
Bremmer
's
Iraq
,
and
no
one
exploded
himself
.
The
only
way
to
fight
this
new
"
popular
"
weapon
is
identical
to
the
only
way
in
which
you
fight
organized
crime
or
pirates
on
the
high
seas
:
the
offensive
way
.
Like
in
the
case
of
organized
crime
,
it
is
crucial
that
the
forces
on
the
offensive
be
united
and
it
is
crucial
to
reach
the
top
of
the
crime
pyramid
.
You
can
not
eliminate
organized
crime
by
arresting
the
little
drug
dealer
on
the
street
corner
.
You
must
go
after
the
head
of
the
"
Family
"
.
If
part
of
the
public
supports
it
,
others
tolerate
it
,
many
are
afraid
of
it
and
some
try
to
explain
it
away
by
poverty
or
by
a
miserable
childhood
,
organized
crime
will
thrive
and
so
will
terrorism
.
Russia
is
beginning
to
understand
it
.
Turkey
understands
it
well
.
I
am
very
much
afraid
that
most
of
Europe
still
does
not
understand
it
.
Unfortunately
,
it
seems
that
Europe
will
understand
it
only
after
suicide
murders
arrive
in
Europe
in
a
big
way
.
In
my
humble
opinion
,
this
will
definitely
happen
.
The
Spanish
trains
and
the
Istanbul
bombings
are
only
the
beginning
.
The
unity
of
the
Civilized
World
in
fighting
this
horror
is
absolutely
indispensable
.
Until
Europe
wakes
up
,
this
unity
will
not
be
achieved
.
*
2
.
The
second
ingredient
is
words
,
more
precisely
lies
.
*
Words
can
be
lethal
.
They
kill
people
.
It
is
often
said
that
politicians
,
diplomats
and
perhaps
also
lawyers
and
business
people
must
sometimes
lie
,
as
part
of
their
professional
life
.
An
incredible
number
of
people
in
the
Arab
world
believe
that
September
11
never
happened
,
or
was
an
American
provocation
or
,
even
better
,
a
Jewish
plot
.
You
all
remember
the
Iraqi
Minister
of
Information
,
Mr.
Mouhamad
Said
al
-
Sahaf
and
his
press
conferences
when
the
US
forces
were
already
inside
Baghdad
.
Disinformation
at
time
of
war
is
an
accepted
tactic
.
But
to
stand
,
day
after
day
,
and
to
make
such
preposterous
statements
,
known
to
everybody
to
be
lies
,
without
even
being
ridiculed
in
your
own
milieu
,
can
only
happen
in
this
region
.
Mr.
Sahaf
eventually
became
a
popular
icon
as
a
court
jester
,
but
this
did
not
stop
some
allegedly
respectable
newspapers
from
giving
him
equal
time
.
It
also
does
not
prevent
the
Western
press
from
giving
credence
,
every
day
,
even
now
,
to
similar
liars
.
After
all
,
if
you
want
to
be
an
anti-Semite
,
there
are
subtle
ways
of
doing
it
.
You
do
not
have
to
claim
that
the
holocaust
never
happened
,
and
that
the
Jewish
temple
in
Jerusalem
never
existed
.
When
these
same
leaders
make
other
statements
,
the
Western
media
report
them
as
if
they
could
be
true
.
It
is
a
daily
routine
to
hear
the
same
leader
making
opposite
statements
in
Arabic
to
his
people
and
in
English
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.
Incitement
by
Arab
TV
,
accompanied
by
horror
pictures
of
mutilated
bodies
,
has
become
a
powerful
weapon
of
those
who
lie
,
distort
and
want
to
destroy
everything
.
I
recommend
to
you
,
even
though
most
of
you
do
not
understand
Arabic
,
to
watch
Al
Jazeera
,
from
time
to
time
.
You
will
not
believe
your
own
eyes
.
But
words
also
work
in
other
ways
,
more
subtle
.
You
may
support
or
oppose
the
Iraq
war
,
but
to
refer
to
fans
of
Saddam
,
Arafat
or
Bin
Laden
as
peace
activists
is
a
bit
too
much
.
She
is
called
"
martyr
"
by
several
Arab
leaders
and
called
"
activist
"
by
the
European
press
.
Dignitaries
condemn
the
act
but
visit
her
bereaved
family
and
the
money
flows
.
There
is
a
new
game
in
town
:
The
actual
murderer
is
called
"
the
military
wing
"
,
the
one
who
pays
him
,
equips
him
and
sends
him
is
now
called
"
the
political
wing
"
and
the
head
of
the
operation
is
called
the
"
spiritual
leader
"
.
There
are
numerous
other
examples
of
such
Orwellian
nomenclature
,
used
every
day
not
only
by
terror
chiefs
but
also
by
Western
media
.
These
words
are
much
more
dangerous
than
many
people
realize
.
They
provide
an
emotional
infrastructure
for
atrocities
.
It
was
Joseph
Goebbels
who
said
that
if
you
repeat
a
lie
often
enough
,
people
will
believe
it
.
He
is
now
being
outperformed
by
his
successors
.
*
3
.
The
third
aspect
is
money
.
*
Huge
amounts
of
money
,
which
could
have
solved
many
social
problems
in
this
dysfunctional
part
of
the
world
,
are
channeled
into
three
concentric
spheres
supporting
death
and
murder
.
In
the
inner
circle
are
the
terrorists
themselves
.
The
money
funds
their
travel
,
explosives
,
hideouts
and
permanent
search
for
soft
vulnerable
targets
.
The
inner
circles
are
primarily
financed
by
terrorist
states
like
Iran
and
Syria
,
until
recently
also
by
Iraq
and
Libya
and
earlier
also
by
some
of
the
Communist
regimes
.
These
states
,
as
well
as
the
Palestinian
Authority
,
are
the
safe
havens
of
the
wholesale
murder
vendors
.
Finally
,
we
find
the
third
circle
of
so
-
called
religious
,
educational
and
welfare
organizations
,
which
actually
do
some
good
,
feed
the
hungry
and
provide
some
schooling
,
but
brainwash
a
new
generation
with
hatred
,
lies
and
ignorance
.
This
circle
operates
mostly
through
mosques
,
madrasas
and
other
religious
establishments
but
also
through
inciting
electronic
and
printed
media
.
The
Saudi
regime
,
of
course
,
will
be
the
next
victim
of
major
terror
,
when
the
inner
circle
will
explode
into
the
outer
circle
.
The
Saudis
are
beginning
to
understand
it
,
but
they
fight
the
inner
circles
,
while
still
financing
the
infrastructure
at
the
outer
circle
.
Figuratively
speaking
,
this
outer
circle
is
the
guardian
,
which
makes
sure
that
the
people
look
and
listen
inwards
to
the
inner
circle
of
terror
and
incitement
,
rather
than
to
the
world
outside
.
Some
parts
of
this
same
outer
circle
actually
operate
as
a
result
of
fear
from
,
or
blackmail
by
,
the
inner
circles
.
The
horrifying
added
factor
is
the
high
birth
rate
.
Half
of
the
population
of
the
Arab
world
is
under
the
age
of
20
,
the
most
receptive
age
to
incitement
,
guaranteeing
two
more
generations
of
blind
hatred
.
Some
of
the
leaders
of
these
various
circles
live
very
comfortably
on
their
loot
.
The
Jihad
"
soldiers
"
join
packaged
death
tours
to
Iraq
and
other
hotspots
,
while
some
of
their
leaders
ski
in
Switzerland
.
*
4
.
The
fourth
element
of
the
current
world
conflict
is
the
total
breaking
of
all
laws
.
*
The
civilized
world
believes
in
democracy
,
the
rule
of
law
,
including
international
law
,
human
rights
,
free
speech
and
free
press
,
among
other
liberties
.
Never
in
history
,
not
even
in
the
Nazi
period
,
was
there
such
total
disregard
of
all
of
the
above
as
we
observe
now
.
Every
student
of
political
science
debates
how
you
prevent
an
anti-democratic
force
from
winning
a
democratic
election
and
abolishing
democracy
.
Other
aspects
of
a
civilized
society
must
also
have
limitations
.
Can
a
policeman
open
fire
on
someone
trying
to
kill
him
?
Can
a
government
listen
to
phone
conversations
of
terrorists
and
drug
dealers
?
Does
free
speech
protect
you
when
you
shout
"
fire
"
in
a
crowded
theater
?
Should
there
be
death
penalty
,
for
deliberate
multiple
murders
?
These
are
the
old
-
fashioned
dilemmas
.
But
now
we
have
an
entire
new
set
.
Do
you
raid
a
mosque
,
which
serves
as
a
terrorist
ammunition
storage
?
Do
you
return
fire
,
if
you
are
attacked
from
a
hospital
?
Do
you
storm
a
church
taken
over
by
terrorists
who
took
the
priests
hostages
?
Do
you
strip
every
woman
because
one
pretended
to
be
pregnant
and
carried
a
suicide
bomb
on
her
belly
?
Do
you
raid
terrorist
headquarters
,
hidden
in
a
mental
hospital
?
What
do
you
do
?
Well
,
you
do
not
want
to
face
the
dilemma
.
But
it
can
not
be
avoided
.
Suppose
,
for
the
sake
of
discussion
,
that
someone
would
openly
stay
in
a
well
-
known
address
in
Teheran
,
hosted
by
the
Iranian
Government
and
financed
by
it
,
executing
one
atrocity
after
another
in
Spain
or
in
France
,
killing
hundreds
of
innocent
people
,
accepting
responsibility
for
the
crimes
,
promising
in
public
TV
interviews
to
do
more
of
the
same
,
while
the
Government
of
Iran
issues
public
condemnations
of
his
acts
but
continues
to
host
him
,
invite
him
to
official
functions
and
treat
him
as
a
great
dignitary
.
I
leave
it
to
you
as
homework
to
figure
out
what
Spain
or
France
would
have
done
,
in
such
a
situation
.
It
is
trying
to
play
ice
hockey
by
sending
a
ballerina
ice
-
skater
into
the
ring
or
to
knock
out
a
heavyweight
boxer
by
a
chess
player
.
The
good
news
is
that
all
of
this
is
temporary
,
because
the
evolution
of
international
law
has
always
adapted
itself
to
reality
.
The
punishment
for
suicide
murder
should
be
death
or
arrest
before
the
murder
,
not
during
and
not
after
.
After
every
world
war
,
the
rules
of
international
law
have
changed
,
and
the
same
will
happen
after
the
present
one
.
But
during
the
twilight
zone
,
a
lot
of
harm
can
be
done
.
The
picture
I
described
here
is
not
pretty
.
What
can
we
do
about
it
?
In
the
short
run
,
only
fight
and
win
.
In
the
long
run
,
only
educate
the
next
generation
and
open
it
to
the
world
.
The
inner
circles
can
and
must
be
destroyed
by
force
.
The
outer
circle
can
not
be
eliminated
by
force
.
Above
all
,
we
need
a
total
absolute
unity
and
determination
of
the
civilized
world
against
all
three
circles
of
evil
.
Allow
me
,
for
a
moment
,
to
depart
from
my
alleged
role
as
a
taxi
driver
and
return
to
science
.
When
you
have
a
malignant
tumor
,
you
may
remove
the
tumor
itself
surgically
.
You
may
also
starve
it
by
preventing
new
blood
from
reaching
it
from
other
parts
of
the
body
,
thereby
preventing
new
"
supplies
"
from
expanding
the
tumor
.
But
before
you
fight
and
win
,
by
force
or
otherwise
,
you
have
to
realize
that
you
are
in
a
war
,
and
this
may
take
Europe
a
few
more
years
.
In
order
to
win
,
it
is
necessary
to
first
eliminate
the
terrorist
regimes
,
so
that
no
Government
in
the
world
will
serve
as
a
safe
haven
for
these
people
.
I
do
not
want
to
comment
here
on
whether
the
American
-
led
attack
on
Iraq
was
justified
from
the
point
of
view
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
or
any
other
pre-war
argument
,
but
I
can
look
at
the
post-war
map
of
Western
Asia
.
Now
that
Afghanistan
,
Iraq
and
Libya
are
out
,
two
and
a
half
terrorist
states
remain
:
Iran
,
Syria
and
Lebanon
,
the
latter
being
a
Syrian
colony
.
Perhaps
Sudan
should
be
added
to
the
list
.
As
a
result
of
the
conquest
of
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
,
both
Iran
and
Syria
are
now
totally
surrounded
by
territories
unfriendly
to
them
.
Syria
is
surrounded
by
Turkey
,
Iraq
,
Jordan
and
Israel
.
This
is
a
significant
strategic
change
and
it
applies
strong
pressure
on
the
terrorist
countries
.
It
is
not
surprising
that
Iran
is
so
active
in
trying
to
incite
a
Shiite
uprising
in
Iraq
.
I
do
not
know
if
the
American
plan
was
actually
to
encircle
both
Iran
and
Syria
,
but
that
is
the
resulting
situation
.
In
my
humble
opinion
,
the
number
one
danger
to
the
world
today
is
Iran
and
its
regime
.
It
has
an
ideology
which
claims
supremacy
over
Western
culture
.
It
is
ruthless
.
It
has
proven
that
it
can
execute
elaborate
terrorist
acts
without
leaving
too
many
traces
,
using
Iranian
Embassies
.
It
is
clearly
trying
to
develop
nuclear
weapons
.
Its
so
-
called
moderates
and
conservatives
play
their
own
virtuoso
version
of
the
"
good
-
cop
versus
bad
-
cop
"
game
.
Iran
sponsors
Syrian
terrorism
,
it
is
certainly
behind
much
of
the
action
in
Iraq
,
it
is
fully
funding
the
Hezbollah
and
,
through
it
,
the
Palestinian
Hamas
and
Islamic
Jihad
;
it
performed
acts
of
terror
at
least
in
Europe
and
in
South
America
and
probably
also
in
Uzbekistan
and
Saudi
Arabia
and
it
truly
leads
a
multi-national
terror
consortium
,
which
includes
,
as
minor
players
,
Syria
,
Lebanon
and
certain
Shiite
elements
in
Iraq
.
Nevertheless
,
most
European
countries
still
trade
with
Iran
,
try
to
appease
it
and
refuse
to
read
the
clear
signals
.
In
order
to
win
the
war
it
is
also
necessary
to
dry
the
financial
resources
of
the
terror
conglomerate
.
It
is
pointless
to
try
to
understand
the
subtle
differences
between
the
Sunni
terror
of
Al
Qaeda
and
Hamas
and
the
Shiite
terror
of
Hezbollah
,
Sadr
and
other
Iranian
-
inspired
enterprises
.
When
it
serves
their
business
needs
,
all
of
them
collaborate
beautifully
.
It
is
crucial
to
stop
Saudi
and
other
financial
support
of
the
outer
circle
,
which
is
the
fertile
breeding
ground
of
terror
.
It
is
important
to
monitor
all
donations
from
the
Western
World
to
Islamic
organizations
,
to
monitor
the
finances
of
international
relief
organizations
and
to
react
with
forceful
economic
measures
to
any
small
sign
of
financial
aid
to
any
of
the
three
circles
of
terrorism
.
It
is
also
important
to
act
decisively
against
the
campaign
of
lies
and
fabrications
and
to
monitor
those
Western
media
who
collaborate
with
it
out
of
naivety
,
financial
interests
or
ignorance
.
Above
all
,
never
surrender
to
terror
.
No
one
will
ever
know
whether
the
recent
elections
in
Spain
would
have
yielded
a
different
result
,
if
not
for
the
train
bombings
a
few
days
earlier
.
But
it
really
does
not
matter
.
What
matters
is
that
the
terrorists
believe
that
they
caused
the
result
and
that
they
won
by
driving
Spain
out
of
Iraq
.
In
the
long
run
,
Spain
itself
will
pay
even
more
.
Is
the
solution
a
democratic
Arab
world
?
If
democracy
is
just
free
elections
,
it
is
likely
that
the
most
fanatic
regime
will
be
elected
,
the
one
whose
incitement
and
fabrications
are
the
most
inflammatory
.
We
have
seen
it
already
in
Algeria
and
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
in
Turkey
.
It
will
happen
again
,
if
the
ground
is
not
prepared
very
carefully
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
the
civilized
world
will
prevail
.
But
the
longer
it
takes
us
to
understand
the
new
landscape
of
this
war
,
the
more
costly
and
painful
the
victory
will
be
.
Europe
,
more
than
any
other
region
,
is
the
key
.
A
key
question
is
how
they
acquired
the
anthrax
strain
first
isolated
by
the
Texas
Veterinary
Medical
Diagnostic
Lab
in
1980
.

Homeland
Security
An
early
September
2003
Newsweek
article
included
a
rumor
by
a
Taliban
source
that
at
a
meeting
in
April
2003
Bin
Laden
was
planning
an
"
unbelievable
"
biological
attack
,
the
plans
for
which
had
suffered
a
setback
upon
the
arrest
of
Khalid
Shaikh
Mohammed
(
"
KSM
"
)
.
He
had
been
captured
the
previous
month
in
Rawalpindi
,
Pakistan
.
In
November
2003
,
a
report
by
a
UN
Panel
of
experts
concluded
that
Al
Qaeda
is
determined
to
use
chemical
and
biological
weapons
and
is
restrained
only
by
technical
difficulties
.
In
a
statement
issued
June
16
,
2004
,
the
9/11
Commission
Staff
concluded
that
"
Al
Qaeda
had
an
ambitious
biological
weapons
program
and
was
making
advances
in
its
ability
to
produce
anthrax
prior
to
September
11
.
On
August
9
,
2004
,
it
was
announced
that
in
the
Spring
of
2001
,
a
man
named
El
-
Shukrijumah
,
also
known
as
Jafar
the
Pilot
,
who
was
part
of
a
"
second
wave
,
"
had
been
casing
New
York
City
helicopters
.
Photographs
from
a
seized
computer
disc
included
the
controls
and
the
locks
on
the
door
between
the
passengers
and
pilot
.
In
a
bulletin
,
the
FBI
noted
that
the
surveillance
might
relate
to
a
plot
to
disperse
a
chemical
or
biological
weapon
.
The
CIA
reportedly
has
been
quietly
building
a
case
that
the
anthrax
mailings
were
an
international
plot
.
This
is
old
news
.
It
's
just
no
longer
bureaucratically
impolite
to
openly
contest
the
FBI
's
(
former
)
theory
about
a
lone
,
American
scientist
.
Many
people
have
argued
that
a
US
-
based
Al
Qaeda
operative
is
behind
the
earlier
Fall
2001
anthrax
mailings
in
the
US
,
and
that
the
mailings
served
as
a
threat
and
warning
.
The
Prophet
's
guidance
,
says
Michael
Scheuer
,
an
al
-
Qaeda
analyst
who
recently
retired
from
the
CIA
and
once
headed
its
Bin
Laden
unit
,
"
was
always
,
Before
you
attack
someone
,
warn
them
very
clearly
...
"
The
anthrax
mailings
followed
the
pattern
of
letters
they
sent
in
January
1997
to
newspaper
branches
in
Washington
,
D.C.
and
New
York
City
,
as
well
as
symbolic
targets
.
The
letter
bombs
were
sent
in
connection
with
the
detention
of
the
blind
sheik
Abdel
Rahman
and
those
responsible
for
the
earlier
World
Trade
Center
bombing
in
1993
.
Handwritten
notes
and
files
on
a
laptop
seized
upon
the
capture
of
KSM
,
Al
Qaeda
's
#
3
,
included
a
feasible
anthrax
production
plan
using
a
spray
dryer
and
addressed
the
recruitment
of
necessary
expertise
.
What
your
morning
paper
did
not
tell
you
,
however
,
was
that
the
CIA
seized
a
similar
disc
from
Ayman
Zawahiri
's
right
-
hand
,
Ahmed
Salama
Mabruk
,
5
years
earlier
.
The
computer
disk
was
confiscated
from
him
during
his
arrest
by
the
CIA
in
Azerbaijan
and
handed
over
to
the
Egyptian
authorities
.
Mabruk
,
at
the
time
,
was
the
head
of
Jihad
's
military
operations
.
There
is
a
risk
that
observers
underestimate
the
time
that
Al
Qaeda
has
had
to
make
progress
in
such
recruitment
and
research
and
development
.
Some
may
still
think
that
even
in
the
final
stages
of
the
9/11
plot
,
Zacarias
Moussaoui
was
going
to
fly
a
5th
plane
into
the
Capitol
or
White
House
.
Others
argue
that
he
was
to
be
part
of
a
second
wave
of
airliners
directed
to
targets
on
the
West
Coast
.
There
is
an
e-mail
by
Moussaoui
,
however
,
dated
July
31
,
2001
indicating
that
he
sought
to
take
a
crop
dusting
course
that
was
to
last
up
to
6
months
.
In
March
2003
,
Mohammed
reportedly
said
that
Moussaoui
was
not
going
to
be
part
of
9/11
but
was
to
be
part
of
a
"
second
wave
.
"
Although
Ramzi
Binalshibh
provided
him
$
14,000
in
July
,
accused
September
11
conspirator
Zacarias
Moussaoui
told
his
trial
judge
that
he
had
an
al
Qaeda
mission
that
would
have
come
after
the
terrorist
attacks
.
Zacarias
Moussaoui
,
never
the
sharpest
tool
in
the
shed
and
thought
by
his
superiors
to
be
unreliable
,
has
told
the
judge
at
his
trial
in
a
filing
that
he
wants
"
anthrax
for
Jew
sympathizer
only
.
"
Al
Qaeda
's
regional
operative
,
Hambali
,
who
was
at
a
key
January
2000
meeting
and
supervised
Sufaat
,
has
been
captured
.
Hambali
reportedly
is
cooperating
to
some
degree
.
KSM
and
Hambali
sent
al
-
Hindi
(
al
-
Britani
)
,
along
with
Jafar
the
Pilot
,
to
case
NYC
targets
for
a
second
wave
.
It
was
as
part
of
that
surveillance
in
early
2001
that
Jafar
the
Pilot
studied
tourist
helicopters
in
the
NYC
area
.
Sufaat
,
according
to
both
KSM
and
Hambali
,
did
not
have
the
virulent
US
Army
Ames
strain
that
would
be
used
.
That
would
require
someone
who
had
access
to
the
strain
.
But
if
experience
is
any
guide
,
nothing
would
stand
in
the
way
of
Dr.
Ayman
Zawahiri
's
decade
-
long
quest
to
weaponize
and
use
anthrax
against
US
targets
that
was
described
by
one
confidante
to
an
Egyptian
newspaper
reporter
.
The
islamist
had
been
released
from
Egyptian
prison
and
had
known
Zawahiri
well
for
many
years
.
Emails
from
Zawahiri
to
Atef
in
the
Spring
of
1999
indicate
that
Ayman
was
a
close
student
of
the
USAMRIID
anthrax
program
.
He
believed
that
the
koran
instructed
that
a
jihadist
should
use
the
weapons
used
by
the
crusader
.
What
we
know
is
that
he
's
always
said
it
was
a
religious
obligation
to
have
the
same
weapons
as
their
enemies
,
former
CIA
OBL
unit
counter
terrorism
chief
Michael
Scheuer
has
said
.
A
key
question
is
how
they
acquired
the
anthrax
strain
first
isolated
by
the
Texas
Veterinary
Medical
Diagnostic
Lab
in
1980
.
A
few
days
before
Christmas
2003
,
after
a
renewed
audiotape
threat
by
Zawahiri
of
attacks
,
to
include
in
the
US
homeland
,
the
threat
level
was
raised
to
orange
or
"
high
.
"
After
the
alert
condition
had
long
since
returned
to
yellow
,
Zawahiri
in
late
February
issued
another
audiotape
.
He
urged
the
President
that
brigades
and
brigades
would
be
coming
under
the
banner
of
jihad
carrying
death
and
seeking
paradise
.
Zawahiri
said
that
the
US
should
expect
another
9/11
on
US
soil
.
According
to
some
reports
,
Zawahiri
is
thought
by
intelligence
to
be
somewhere
near
the
border
of
Pakistan
and
Afghanistan
.
At
one
time
,
some
thought
he
had
been
spotted
in
Iran
.
Wherever
he
is
,
authorities
need
to
focus
on
the
traceable
connection
between
him
and
those
he
or
Atef
recruited
.
In
October
2001
,
did
the
FBI
profilers
know
of
the
draft
message
Khalid
Mohammed
had
on
the
seized
laptop
(
from
1995
)
that
was
signed
"
Khalid
Sheik
Bojinka
"
?
The
letter
threatened
to
use
biochemical
weapons
if
the
blind
sheik
was
not
released
.
(
Khalid
Mohammed
's
involvement
dates
back
to
Bojinka
,
as
does
Hambali
's
)
.
In
May
2004
,
Patrick
Hughes
,
Lieutenant
General
(
Retired
)
,
Assistant
Secretary
for
Information
Analysis
,
Homeland
Security
Department
testified
before
the
9/11
Commission
.
He
explained
that
interrogations
and
other
evidence
revealed
that
Al
Qaeda
wanted
to
strike
the
US
with
a
nonconventional
weapon
,
most
notably
anthrax
.
The
same
week
,
the
WTC
head
testified
that
while
they
had
not
received
any
briefing
on
the
use
of
planes
,
they
had
taken
steps
to
prepare
for
an
attack
using
anthrax
based
on
intelligence
that
had
been
received
.
Al
Qaeda
has
had
anthrax
,
the
raw
seed
product
in
its
unweaponized
form
,
since
at
least
1997
,
when
it
was
purchased
by
Bin
Laden
through
the
Moro
Islamic
Liberation
Front
(
"
Moro
Front
"
or
"
MILF
"
)
.
Zawahiri
,
Al
Qaeda
's
#
2
,
is
head
of
Al
Qaeda
's
biochemical
program
.
The
CIA
has
known
of
Zawahiri
's
plans
to
use
anthrax
for
a
half
decade
.
The
confidante
and
right
-
hand
man
of
Dr.
Ayman
Zawahiri
admitted
that
Zawahiri
succeeded
in
obtaining
anthrax
and
intended
to
use
it
against
US
targets
.
Another
senior
Al
Qaeda
member
(
a
shura
or
policy
-
making
council
member
no
less
)
was
working
for
the
Egyptian
intelligence
services
and
he
confirmed
the
report
in
a
sworn
lengthy
confession
.
Even
Zawahiri
's
attorney
in
1999
said
that
Bin
Laden
and
Zawahiri
were
likely
to
resort
to
the
biological
and
chemical
agents
they
possessed
given
the
extradition
pressure
senior
Al
Qaeda
leaders
faced
.
A
recently
released
islamist
who
had
been
a
close
associate
of
Zawahiri
said
that
Zawahiri
spent
a
decade
and
had
made
15
separate
attempts
to
recruit
the
necessary
expertise
to
weaponize
anthrax
in
Russia
and
the
Middle
East
.
The
US
Army
recipe
was
not
used
,
and
obtaining
the
unprocessed
Ames
strain
of
anthrax
used
does
not
warrant
the
weight
given
it
by
some
press
accounts
.
There
was
lax
control
over
the
distribution
of
the
Ames
strain
that
was
used
,
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
transfers
were
not
even
required
to
be
recorded
prior
to
1997
.
Significantly
,
the
individual
who
isolated
it
nearly
a
quarter
century
ago
(
now
retired
)
,
upon
being
contacted
,
does
not
even
report
that
he
necessarily
sent
the
only
copy
of
the
strain
to
Ft.
Detrick
.
Senator
Patrick
Leahy
at
a
Congressional
hearing
in
the
Spring
of
2002
noted
that
the
FBI
had
collected
the
Ames
strain
from
20
sources
.
In
Fall
2004
,
MSNBC
,
relying
on
an
unnamed
FBI
spokesperson
,
reports
that
the
FBI
has
narrowed
the
pool
of
labs
known
to
have
had
Ames
that
was
a
match
from
16
to
4
but
can
not
rule
out
that
it
was
made
overseas
.
At
least
according
to
the
public
comments
by
bioweaponeer
experts
William
Patrick
and
Kenneth
Alibek
,
under
the
optimal
method
,
there
is
no
electrostatic
charge
.
In
the
case
of
the
anthrax
used
in
the
mailings
,
there
was
an
electrostatic
charge
.
Although
there
was
a
dominance
of
single
spores
and
a
trillion
spore
concentration
,
there
were
clumps
as
large
as
40
-
100
microns
.
(
Spores
must
be
no
bigger
than
5
microns
to
be
inhalable
.
)
Many
point
to
the
trillion
spore
concentration
as
extraordinary
.
The
"
trillion
spore
"
issue
was
at
the
heart
of
a
lot
of
mistaken
theories
of
the
matter
concluding
that
state
sponsorship
was
necessarily
indicated
.
The
reported
finding
at
Dugway
undermines
the
argument
of
both
the
"
bomb
Iraq
"
crowd
and
the
liberals
focused
on
Dr.
Steve
Hatfill
who
object
to
US
biodefense
research
because
they
view
it
as
being
useful
for
offensive
purposes
.
Although
the
details
of
the
documents
on
Mohammed
's
computer
may
(
or
may
not
)
point
to
possible
difficulties
in
aerial
dispersal
,
they
are
fully
consistent
with
the
product
used
in
the
anthrax
mailings
.
Al
Qaeda
had
both
the
means
and
opportunity
.
US
-
trained
Malaysian
biochemist
Yazid
Sufaat
met
with
9/11
plotters
and
two
hijackers
in
January
2000
.
Sufaat
was
a
member
of
Al
Qaeda
and
a
member
of
Jemaah
Islamiah
(
"
JI
"
)
.
JI
has
ties
with
the
Moro
Front
.
Sufaat
used
his
company
called
Green
Laboratory
Medicine
to
buy
items
useful
to
Al
Qaeda
.
(
Green
symbolizes
"
Islam
"
and
Prophet
Mohammed
's
holy
war
)
.
Zacarias
Moussaoui
,
who
had
a
crop
dusting
manual
when
he
was
arrested
,
stayed
at
Sufaat
's
condominium
in
2000
when
he
was
trying
to
arrange
for
flight
lessons
in
Malaysia
.
The
crop
dusters
were
to
be
part
of
a
"
second
wave
.
"
After
9/11
,
Yazid
Sufaat
traveled
to
Afghanistan
and
Pakistan
to
work
for
the
Taliban
Medical
Brigade
and
to
continue
his
work
with
anthrax
.
As
described
in
US
News
,
a
former
reporter
from
the
Kabul
Times
actually
may
have
met
Sufaat
,
without
realizing
it
,
while
traveling
near
Kabul
in
October
2001
,
perceiving
him
as
Filipino
.
The
fellow
was
carrying
papers
from
Zawahiri
and
bragging
about
his
ability
to
manipulate
anthrax
.
Sufaat
was
arrested
in
December
2001
upon
his
return
to
Malaysia
.
Newsweek
reported
that
a
"
second
wave
"
involving
biological
attacks
had
been
thwarted
upon
the
arrest
of
Al
Qaeda
members
who
had
been
intended
to
provide
logistical
support
.
Various
doctors
,
both
foreign
and
American
,
are
associated
with
Al
Qaeda
leaders
or
operatives
,
to
include
the
doctors
Abdul
Qadoos
Khan
,
a
bacteriologist
from
Rawalpindi
and
Aafia
Siddiqui
,
PhD
,
from
Karachi
.
Microbiologist
Abdul
Qadoos
Khan
was
charged
along
with
his
son
,
Ahmed
,
for
harboring
the
fugitives
.
As
of
March
28
,
2003
,
he
was
in
a
hospital
for
a
cardiac
problem
and
had
been
granted
"
pre-arrest
bail
.
"
Yet
all
you
read
about
at
the
time
was
the
arrest
of
the
son
Ahmed
Abdul
Qadoos
,
who
receives
a
stipend
from
the
UN
for
being
officially
low
-
IQ
due
to
lead
poisoning
.
It
was
Khalid
Mohammed
who
told
authorities
about
Aafia
Siddiqui
,
who
has
a
PhD
from
Brandeis
in
neurology
.
The
Pakistani
press
reported
that
she
was
nabbed
in
Karachi
after
being
spotted
at
the
airport
in
late
March
or
early
April
2003
.
If
mistaken
,
how
did
those
reports
first
come
about
?
Understandably
,
Amerithrax
is
a
confidential
investigation
.
The
Pakistan
ISI
and
CIA
rarely
grant
press
interviews
in
connection
with
an
ongoing
manhunt
.
The
CIA
did
not
even
allow
the
FBI
access
to
KSM
for
10
days
after
his
arrest
.
As
agent
Van
Harp
,
then
head
of
the
Amerithrax
investigation
said
,
the
information
coming
from
Khalid
Mohammed
is
classified
with
the
authorities
releasing
only
certain
limited
information
.
While
it
's
not
easy
to
separate
fact
from
fiction
,
Attorney
General
Ashcroft
and
Director
Mueller
have
publicly
confirmed
Aafia
is
still
being
sought
.
They
would
know
.
According
to
the
Pakistan
reports
,
Aafia
Siddiqui
was
detained
after
being
spotted
at
Karachi
International
airport
(
after
she
was
followed
to
a
relative
's
house
)
.
(
Karachi
is
in
the
south
)
.
The
reports
say
she
is
suspected
of
having
been
a
member
of
Al
Qaeda
's
"
Chemical
Wire
Group
.
"
The
family
's
lawyer
advises
me
that
Aafia
did
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
airfare
tickets
for
herself
and
the
kids
and
called
Ismat
from
the
train
station
.
That
was
the
last
Ismat
heard
from
her
.
Aafia
never
reached
the
uncle
's
house
.
Perhaps
something
got
lost
in
the
translation
,
but
the
phrase
"
Chemical
Wire
Group
"
has
appeared
in
all
the
english
Pakistan
and
India
papers
.
The
family
's
attorney
advises
me
that
Aafia
had
no
knowledge
of
chemicals
(
and
that
would
not
appear
to
be
her
training
)
.
There
still
is
a
very
hot
pursuit
of
the
"
Atta
-
level
"
Floridian
,
Adnan
El
Shukrijumah
,
who
Siddiqui
is
thought
to
have
known
and
been
assisting
.
His
nickname
is
"
Jafar
the
Pilot
.
"
A
senior
DOJ
official
reports
that
Adnan
has
experience
as
a
commercial
pilot
.
He
is
said
by
one
FBI
agent
to
be
"
very
,
very
,
very
"
dangerous
.
He
may
have
been
seen
in
Hamilton
,
Canada
--
along
with
Egyptian
al
-
Maati
,
who
apparently
also
has
received
pilot
training
.
It
has
long
been
known
Osama
Bin
Laden
was
interested
in
using
cropdusters
to
disperse
biological
agents
(
since
the
testimony
of
millennium
bomber
Ahmed
Ressam
)
.
The
hijacker
Ahmed
Alhaznawi
appears
to
have
contracted
cutaneous
anthrax
in
Afghanistan
.
It
is
reasonable
to
credit
his
statement
that
he
got
the
lesion
after
bumping
into
a
suitcase
he
was
carrying
at
a
camp
in
Afghanistan
.
The
lesion
is
further
evidence
of
Al
Qaeda
's
anthrax
production
program
at
Kandahar
.
The
present
evidence
relating
to
Atta
's
alleged
travel
to
Prague
does
not
warrant
a
conclusion
that
Al
Qaeda
obtained
the
Ames
strain
from
Iraq
.
Iraq
,
however
,
remains
a
possible
source
of
the
Ames
.
Former
Russian
bioweaponeer
Ken
Alibek
has
said
that
a
key
Russian
scientist
assisted
Iraq
and
that
Russia
had
the
Ames
strain
.
(
His
conclusion
may
have
been
based
on
the
fake
mobile
biolab
plans
foisted
upon
the
US
by
the
Chalabi
associate
"
Curveball
"
,
which
Alibek
divined
to
be
identical
to
Russian
mobile
lab
design
)
.
Zawahiri
did
travel
to
Baghdad
in
1998
with
an
entourage
to
attend
the
birthday
party
of
Saddam
's
son
.
The
papers
found
at
headquarters
of
the
Mukhabarat
,
Iraq
's
secret
police
,
show
that
an
entourage
from
Al
Qaeda
group
was
sent
to
the
Iraqi
capital
in
March
1998
from
Sudan
.
According
to
at
least
some
reports
,
Bin
Laden
rejected
the
suggestion
of
a
closer
alliance
--
preferring
to
pursue
his
own
concept
of
jihad
.
Two
top
Iraqi
scientists
,
code
named
Charlie
and
Alpha
,
are
helping
the
coalition
to
learn
more
about
Iraqi
's
anthrax
program
,
according
to
Dr.
David
Kay
,
head
of
the
Iraq
survey
group
in
charge
of
the
hunt
for
WMD
.
He
has
said
that
the
Iraqis
made
surprising
innovations
in
the
milling
and
drying
processes
needed
to
weaponize
anthrax
.
Al
Qaeda
members
and
sympathizers
feel
that
the
FBI
's
involvement
in
countries
like
Egypt
,
Saudi
Arabia
,
Pakistan
,
Indonesia
,
and
the
Philippines
interferes
with
the
sovereignty
of
those
countries
.
According
to
a
post
she
made
on
the
internet
,
Aafia
Siddiqui
expressed
the
same
sentiment
in
connection
with
US
appropriations
sought
in
exchange
for
the
extradition
of
WTC
1993
plotter
Ramzi
Yousef
from
Pakistan
.
Senator
Leahy
was
Chairman
of
both
the
Judiciary
Committee
overseeing
the
FBI
and
Appropriations
Subcommittee
in
charge
of
foreign
aid
to
these
countries
.
This
extradition
and
imprisonment
of
Al
Qaeda
leaders
,
along
with
US
support
for
Israel
and
the
Mubarak
government
in
Egypt
,
remains
foremost
in
the
mind
of
Dr.
Zawahiri
.
At
the
height
of
the
development
of
his
biological
weapons
program
,
his
brother
was
extradited
pursuant
to
a
death
sentence
in
the
"
Albanian
returnees
"
case
(
now
he
faces
retrial
)
.
It
's
hard
to
keep
up
with
the
stories
about
billion
dollar
appropriations
,
debt
forgiveness
,
and
loan
guarantees
to
countries
like
Egypt
and
Israel
and
now
even
Pakistan
.
Al
Qaeda
had
a
motive
in
mind
.
Zawahiri
argued
instead
that
they
have
been
active
since
the
assassination
of
Anwar
Sadat
in
Egypt
because
of
the
Camp
David
Accord
and
the
resulting
peace
treaty
between
Egypt
and
Israel
.
The
anthrax
letters
were
sent
on
the
date
of
the
Camp
David
Accord
and
then
the
date
Anwar
Sadat
was
assassinated
as
if
to
underscore
the
point
to
anyone
paying
attention
.
Attorney
General
Ashcroft
explained
that
an
"
either
-
or
"
approach
is
not
useful
.
There
is
an
emerging
consensus
that
anthrax
was
contained
in
a
letter
to
AMI
,
the
publisher
of
the
National
Enquirer
--
in
a
goofy
love
letter
to
Jennifer
Lopez
enclosing
a
Star
of
David
and
proposing
marriage
.
(
The
letters
were
to
different
AMI
publications
--
one
to
the
National
Enquirer
and
another
to
The
Sun
)
.
(
News
assistant
Bobby
Bender
recalls
the
letter
containing
the
items
to
have
been
addressed
to
The
Sun
.
)
They
were
sent
in
connection
with
the
earlier
bombing
of
the
World
Trade
Center
and
the
imprisonment
of
the
blind
sheik
,
Sheik
Abdel
Rahman
.
The
former
leader
of
the
Egyptian
Al
-
Gamaa
al
-
Islamiya
(
"
Islamic
Group
"
)
,
he
was
also
a
spiritual
leader
of
Al
Qaeda
.
The
purpose
of
the
letter
bombs
--
which
resulted
in
minimal
casualty
--
was
to
send
a
message
.
(
There
initially
was
an
outstanding
$
2
million
reward
--
under
the
rewards
for
justice
program
,
the
reward
now
is
up
to
$
5
million
.
)
.
There
was
no
claim
of
responsibility
.
There
was
no
explanation
.
Once
one
had
been
received
,
the
next
ten
,
mailed
on
two
separate
dates
,
were
easily
collected
.
Sound
familiar
?
Two
bombs
were
also
sent
to
Leavenworth
,
where
a
key
WTC
1993
defendant
was
imprisoned
,
addressed
to
"
Parole
Officer
.
"
(
The
position
does
not
exist
)
.
Abdel
Rahman
's
son
was
captured
in
Quetta
,
Pakistan
in
mid-February
2003
.
That
arrest
in
turn
led
to
the
dramatic
capture
of
Khalid
Mohammed
,
Al
Qaeda
's
#
3
.
Mohammed
allegedly
was
hiding
in
the
home
of
the
Pakistani
bacteriologist
Dr.
Abdul
Qadoos
Khan
.
Along
with
Zawahiri
,
Abdel
Rahman
and
his
two
sons
have
had
considerable
influence
over
Bin
Laden
.
He
reportedly
treated
them
like
sons
.
Although
while
in
jail
in
the
early
1980s
,
Zawahiri
caused
considerable
tension
by
challenging
the
blind
sheik
's
ability
to
lead
a
coalition
of
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
and
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Group
,
Zawahiri
and
OBL
are
Rahman
's
friends
.
The
imprisoned
WTC
1993
plotter
Yousef
was
KSM
's
nephew
.
Thus
,
the
leaders
in
charge
of
Al
Qaeda
's
anthrax
production
program
had
a
close
connection
to
those
imprisoned
in
connection
with
the
earlier
bombing
of
the
World
Trade
Center
.
According
to
the
controversial
"
Feith
memo
,
"
which
summarized
purported
intelligence
showing
an
Iraqi
/
Al
Qaeda
connection
,
Osama
Bin
Laden
had
asked
Iraqi
intelligence
for
technical
assistance
in
sending
letter
bombs
a
half
year
before
the
Al
Hayat
letters
were
sent
.
Just
because
Al
Qaeda
likes
its
truck
bombs
and
the
like
to
be
effective
does
not
mean
they
do
not
see
the
value
in
a
deadly
missive
.
As
Brian
Jenkins
once
said
,
"
terrorism
is
theater
.
"
A
sender
purporting
to
be
islamist
sent
cyanide
in
both
early
2002
and
early
2003
in
New
Zealand
and
ingredients
of
nerve
gas
in
Belgium
in
2003
.
There
's
even
a
chapter
titled
"
Poisonous
Letter
"
in
the
Al
Qaeda
manual
.
The
"
Federal
Eagle
"
stamp
used
in
the
anthrax
mailings
was
a
blue
-
green
.
In
the
very
interview
in
which
they
admitted
9/11
,
and
described
the
codes
used
for
the
four
targets
for
the
planes
,
the
masterminds
admitted
to
the
Jenny
code
,
the
code
for
representing
the
date
9/11
,
and
used
the
symbolism
of
the
"
Green
Birds
.
"
The
mailer
's
use
of
"
Greendale
School
"
as
the
return
address
for
the
letters
to
the
Senators
is
also
revealing
.
Green
symbolizes
Islam
and
was
the
Prophet
Mohammed
's
color
.
By
Greendale
School
,
the
anthrax
perp
was
being
cute
,
just
as
Yazid
Sufaat
was
being
cute
in
naming
his
lab
Green
Laboratory
Medicine
.
Dale
means
"
river
valley
.
"
Greendale
likely
refers
to
green
river
valley
--
i.e.
,
Cairo
's
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
or
the
Islamic
Group
.
The
sender
probably
is
announcing
that
he
is
of
either
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
,
Egyptian
Islamic
Group
or
Jihad
-
al
Qaeda
,
which
is
actually
the
full
name
of
the
group
after
the
merger
of
the
Egyptian
Islamic
Jihad
and
al
Qaeda
.
In
a
Hadith
the
Messenger
of
Allah
explains
that
the
souls
of
the
martyrs
are
in
the
hearts
of
green
birds
that
fly
wherever
they
please
in
the
Paradise
.
The
public
information
mostly
relates
to
those
suspected
sleepers
who
have
been
detained
or
who
are
at
large
and
are
being
sought
.
He
traveled
under
an
alias
and
was
accompanied
by
a
former
US
Army
sergeant
named
Ali
Mohammed
.
What
mosques
exactly
did
they
visit
and
who
did
they
meet
?
Whatever
your
political
persuasion
,
the
FBI
and
CIA
deserve
our
support
.
We
are
,
after
all
,
in
this
together
.
First
,
the
nature
of
such
an
investigation
is
that
we
lack
sufficient
information
to
second
-
guess
(
or
even
know
)
what
the
FBI
is
doing
.
Media
reports
are
a
poor
approximation
of
reality
because
of
the
lack
of
good
sources
.
Second
,
hindsight
is
20
/
20
.
Third
,
with
the
"
new
age
"
Efrem
Zimbalist
,
Jr.
in
charge
of
the
investigation
,
it
is
not
likely
we
could
do
better
in
striking
the
appropriate
balance
between
due
process
and
national
security
.
Finally
,
the
"
Hatfill
theory
"
seems
to
have
been
exhausted
or
at
least
lost
public
favor
.
The
"
Hatfill
theory
"
accusing
Dr.
Stephen
Hatfill
was
always
highly
dubious
.
The
suspicion
was
founded
on
many
false
premises
,
and
there
was
no
reliable
publicly
known
evidence
indicating
his
guilt
.
The
FBI
's
fixation
on
Hatfill
(
at
least
as
rumored
by
some
reporters
)
may
have
stemmed
from
a
warning
by
one
Senator
that
careers
hung
in
the
balance
.
The
Hatfill
theory
--
to
include
ongoing
interviews
and
ongoing
7
/
24
surveillance
by
8
surveillance
specialists
--
is
now
the
subject
of
pending
civil
rights
and
libel
claims
of
uncertain
merit
.
A
suit
against
the
New
York
Times
and
columnist
Nicholas
Kristof
was
dismissed
in
late
November
2004
.
The
judge
had
agreed
to
delay
the
civil
rights
matter
from
proceeding
until
at
least
October
2004
.
The
judge
,
frustrated
by
the
apparent
lack
of
progress
,
encouraged
that
the
parties
reach
a
negotiated
compromise
that
would
permit
some
limited
discovery
to
proceed
(
and
the
judge
has
directed
that
the
government
to
file
an
Answer
to
the
Complaint
)
.
The
Hatfill
Theory
ironically
might
best
be
understood
as
an
Al
Qaeda
theory
,
with
a
coincidental
Malaysian
connection
adding
to
the
other
circumstances
.
Given
the
regrettable
leaks
that
he
was
under
suspicion
,
it
is
only
fair
that
the
FBI
leak
with
equal
enthusiasm
the
fact
that
Dr.
Hatfill
has
now
been
dropped
as
a
suspect
if
and
when
that
proves
to
be
the
case
.
A
search
of
Dr.
Ken
Berry
's
residences
likely
will
prove
just
about
the
last
gasp
of
a
biodefense
insider
theory
.
Senior
officials
have
been
quoted
in
the
press
as
saying
that
the
searches
were
for
the
purpose
of
excluding
him
as
much
as
including
him
.
Maureen
,
Andre
is
going
to
look
over
the
list
of
curves
needed
for
the
global
assets
(
August
Board
meeting
)
one
more
time
before
I
forward
it
to
you
.
He
will
make
sure
that
we
do
not
request
FX
and
inflation
(
CPI
,
PPI
,
etc.
)
curves
when
only
one
of
the
curves
will
actually
be
used
in
the
valuation
process
and
to
determine
which
inflation
index
is
needed
.
Typically
,
we
receive
both
FX
and
inflation
from
you
,
but
both
curves
may
not
always
be
used
.
I
hope
that
we
can
give
you
some
time
savings
by
eliminating
any
nonessential
requests
.
For
now
,
this
is
the
list
of
countries
for
which
we
will
probably
need
the
FX
and
/
or
inflation
curves
.
I
will
send
the
specifics
per
Andre
later
today
.
India
Philippines
Bolivia
Jamaica
Guatemala
Venezuela
Columbia
Puerto
Rico
CPI
only
(
I
need
historical
inflation
data
,
as
well
)
Panama
Brazil
we
have
current
data
already
China
we
have
current
data
already
Euro
inflation
only
I
am
not
certain
about
the
needs
for
the
London
Underwriting
/
IV
group
but
will
request
the
information
from
them
if
you
have
not
done
so
already
.
Thanks
!
Cindy
David
and
Cindy
,
Please

the
list
of

you

to

Have
you
had
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
invitation
yet
?
We
are
aiming
to
have
the
programme
printed
next
week
,
so
I
would
really
need
to

be
available

at
this
year
's
congress
.
I
am

FYI
Vince
Anne
,
Mike
will
call
you
regarding
Sarah
.
Vince
,
As
I
mentioned
in
my
voice
mail
,
Mike
Roberts
going
to
hire
Sara
Woody
,
a
recent
MBA
grad
from
Rice
,
into
his
group
.
However
,
when
we
were
talking
about
this
position
,
Mike
compared
Sara
to
Elena
.
Elena
's
title
is
admin
coordinator
,
and
I
know
that
Sara
should
not
have
this
title
,
and
honestly
do
not
think
that
Elena
should
also
.
If
the
latter
is
the
case
,
we
could
place
both
Sara
and
Elena
in
a
specialist
job
group
(
the
salary
range
is
33
-
66
K
)
.
Please
advise
.
Thanks
,
Anne

Thanks

Martin
's
box
is
working
wonderfully
-
I
'll
have
everything
transferred
to
it
and
give
him
the
keys
by
Friday
.
This
was
(
another
)
nice
deal
for
Enron
.
We
save
$
21,000
in
real
money
this
way
,
the
cash
refund
Sun
is
giving
Enron
for
our
other
server
,
using
a
box
that
was
n't
being
used
by
anyone
.
I
'm
happy
about
this
.
Clayton
Iris

Anne

please

Vince
Michael
:
Thanks
for
putting
the
paperwork
together
.
I
would
have
interest
in
meeting
if
you
can
present
unique
investment
opportunities
that
I
do
n't
have
access
to
now
.
Most
of
my
contact
with
financial
advisors
in
the
past
has
consisted
of
them
suggesting
a
mutual
fund
,
telling
me
to
invest
in
Home
Depot
,
Sun
,
and
Coke
,
or
trying
to
pass
off
their
banks
'
biased
research
reports
as
something
valuable
.
The
above
services
provide
no
value
to
me
personally
.
If
you
can
present
opportunities
such
as
access
to
private
equity
or
hedge
funds
,
or
other
ideas
with
strong
growth
potential
and
low
correlation
to
the
S@P
,
I
'd
listen
.
John
John
-
We
'll
get
the
paperwork
together
and
sent
to
you
for
naked
options
.
At
some
point
,
I
'd
like
to
talk
about
the
diversification
strategy
in
more
detail
--
perhaps
over
dinner
or
a
quick
meeting
after
the
markets
close
?

Michael
:
Appreciate
the
idea
.
However
,
with
my
natural
long
,
I
'm
not
looking
to
really
trade
around
the
position
.
I
believe
ENE
will
continue
to
be
range
bound
,
but
in
case
it
is
not
,
I
do
n't
want
to
forgo
50
%
of
my
option
premium
.
I
have
price
targets
of
where
I
would
like
to
lighten
up
exposure
to
ENE
and
will
use
calls
to
implement
the
stategy
.
To
that
regards
,
I
noticed
I
was
not
approved
to
sell
naked
calls
.
I
would
like
that
ability
in
order
to
hedge
some
exposure
I
have
of
unexercised
vested
options
.
Please
look
into
that
for
me
.
John
.
John
-
I
was
looking
at
the
recent
pullback
in
ENE
and
thinking
it
might
be
an
opportunity
to
buy
back
the
calls
you
sold
.
Of
course
,
you
would
then
be
in
a
position
to
sell
calls
again
if
the
stock
makes
a
bounce
.
I
'm
not
sure
that
ENE
@
75
is
the
place
,
but
maybe
@
73
.
Call
me
if
you
're
interested

Also
,
the

I
have
a
few
entities
that
may
need
to
change
groups
or
be
assigned
to
a
group
.
This
entity
is
not
in
TIS
,
SAP
,
nor
Hyperion
.
There
is
a
corporate
data
sheet
for
this
company
,
but
this
entity
seems
to
have
been
inactive
since
it
's
creation
.
86M
-
Enron
Net
Works
LLC
Despite
the
name
,
this
entity
appears
to
be
a
MTM
company
.
The
next
5
companies
were
my
responsibility
while
in
EBS
,
and
did
not
get
assigned
during
the
reorg
.
80Y
-
Enron
Broadband
Acquisition
,
Inc
.
83N
is
my
responsibility
.
I
think
this
entity
should
stay
with
83N
.
So
I
suggest
it
be
assigned
to
Leon
.
It
should
be
4
-
easy
.
1579
-
EBS
Network
Co.
Division
of
17H
.
This
one
should
possibly
be
assigned
to
Networks

Hello
.
I
was
originally
inquiring
about
purchasing
a
Cross
or
Signac
impressionist
lithograph
.
I
found
them
and
purchased
both
from
a
gallery
in
London
,
William
Weston
.
They
should
be
delivered
this
week
.
They
are
beautiful
and
will
add
a
lot
to
our
collection
.
By
the
way
the
Lichtenstein
is
up
and
hanging
in
our
formal
living
room
and
it
is
magnificent
.
I
have
also
purchased
an
Appel
in
the
last
month
.
I
am
interested
in
several
artists
.
Actually
,
a
lot
.
I
will
be
looking
for
one
or
more
of
the
following
.
My
concept
is
that
over
time
I
would
like
to
own
one
of
all
the
following
artists
and
they
are
all
depending
when
I
find
something
that
we
really
like
.
They
are
kind
of
in
rank
order
but
as
I
stated
if
I
find
the
piece
that
I
like
we
will
purchase
it
.
I
want
signed
and
numbered
.
I
realize
that
some
were
not
signed
by
the
artist
but
it
is
an
important
fact
in
my
buying
decision
.
I
also
realize
that
some
may
not
have
done
any
works
on
paper
or
they
are
outrageously
expensive
.
For
example
,
I
would
like
to
know
if
Rothko
or
Kline
did
any
work
on
paper
.
At
least
that
is
what
I
am
thinking
now
.
Bonnard
(
colorful
only
)
Lautrec
Suerat
(
any
works
on
paper
?
-
I
do
n't
know
that
he
did
any
)
Other
impressionist
or
post
impressionist
lithos
Braque
Moore
Arp
Rouault
Modrian
Rothko
Kline
Motherwell
By
the
way
,
I
am
interested
in
re-looking
at
a
Picasso
(
although
we
have
2
)
that
your
gallery
had
a
couple
of
years
ago
.
It
was
for
sale
in
a
couple
of
galleries
in
SF
and
was
about
$
20,000
.
Is
there
1
available
?
Also
I
am
still
thinking
about
the
Matisse
we
discussed
before
but
as
you
can
see
,
I
have
a
lot
of
other
artists
I
am
interested
in
and
it
may
remain
on
the
back
burner
because
we
already
have
one
.

I
have
a
couple
of
questions
so
I
can
wrap
up
the
LOI
:
We
refer
to
licensed
Fuel
Cell
Energy
equipment
.
Do
we
intend
to
reference
a
particular
manufacturer
,
or
should
this
be
more
generic
?
Do
we
want
to
attach
a
draft
of
the
Development
Agreement
,
and
condition
the
final
deal
on
agreeing
to
terms
substantially
the
same
as
what
's
in
the
draft
?
I
have
a
concern
that
the
Enron
optionality
bug
could
bite
us
on
the
backside
with
that
one
.
Do
we
expect
to
have
ONE
EPC
contract
,
or
several
?
I
'm
looking
for
the
confidentiality
agreement
,
which
may
be
in
Bart
's
files
(
have
n't
checked
closely
yet

.
If
anyone

it

,
it
could

Forget
the
ONE
or
more
contract
questions

I
see
we
expect
to

separate
contracts

On
the
issue
of
the
contracts
,
the
draft
says
that
the
$
170
m
is
paid
when
the
EPC
contract
is
signed
.
Are
we
expecting
that
the
portion
attributable
to
each
project
will
be
paid
as
the
individual
EPC
contracts
are
signed
?
Thanks
,
Kay
1
.
The
pricing
that
we
have
given
CRRA
is
specific
to
FuelCell
Energy
and
would
not
be
meaningful
without
listing
the
manufacturer
(
i.e.
,
ONSI
would
be
a
lot
more
money
)
.
Hence
,
I
think
that
we
have
to
reference
the
manufacturer
.
2
.
The
attachment
of
the
Development
Agreement
is
a
Jeff
question
.
In
order
to
mark
any
2000
income
,
we
will
need
to
get
CRRA
to
execute
the
Development
Agreement
in
2000
.
In
my
opinion
,
we
should
show
CRRA
a
copy
of
the
LOI
with
the
assumption
that
the
Development
Agreement
is
attached
.
I
would
actually
send
them
the
draft
Development
Agreement
a
couple
days
after
the
LOI
.
Based
on
how
CRRA
reacts
,
I
would
make
an
ultimate
determination
if
the
agreement
needs
to
be
attached
to
the
LOI
.
3
.
I
expect
at
least
one
EPC
contract
per
project
.
We
do
n't
want
to
condition
the
acceptance
of
one
project
on
the
performance
of
another
project
.
Performance
tests
will
either
be
performed
on
a
project
basis
or
a
unit
by
unit
basis
in
a
given
project
.

Yo
Mama

Your
mama
is
so
fat
:
When
she
hauls
ass
she
has
to
make
two
trips
.
When
she
dances
she
makes
the
band
skip
.
When
she
was
diagnosed
with
the
flesh
eating
disease
the
doctor
gave
her
13
years
to
live
.
She
puts
mayonnaise
on
aspirin
.
(
<-
clearly
the
winner
)
Her
cereal
bowl
came
with
a
lifeguard
.
Her
high
school
graduation
picture
was
an
aerial
photograph
.
Her
driver
`s
license
says
"
Picture
continued
on
other
side
.
"
She
has
to
iron
her
pants
on
the
driveway
.
The
back
of
her
neck
looks
like
a
pack
of
hot
dogs
.
Yo
mama
`s
so
fat
,
all
the
restaurants
in
town
have
signs
that
say
:
"
Maximum
Occupancy
:
240
Patrons
OR
Yo
Mama
"
Yo
mama
`s
so
fat
,
when
she
ran
away
,
they
had
to
use
all
four
sides
of
the
milk
carton
.
Yo
mama
`s
so
fat
,
instead
of
Levis
501
jeans
,
she
wears
Levi`s
1002`s
.
Yo
mama
`s
so
fat
,
when
she
gets
in
an
elevator
,
it
HAS
to
go
down
.
Yo
mama
`s
so
fat
,
she
was
born
with
a
silver
shovel
in
her
mouth
.
Yo
mama
`s
so
fat

she
could
sell
shade
.

waste

got

done

told
him
I
told
you
to
call
him
back
and
at
least
hear
what
he
has
to
say
.
He
said
they
are
looking
for
people
and
based
on
what
I
told
him
an
interview
was
a
formality
.

Is
that
Microwave
that
you

really
expensive

All

Off
and
on
(
with
Jackie
Gentle
's
help
)
I
have
pulled
together
a
one
page
communication
note
on
our
fundamental
operating
standards
(
itself
a
one
page
summary
)
.
We
are
in
the
final
stages
of
this
process
-
where
we
draft
a
cover
letter
for
John
which
will
introduce
this
for
inclusion
within
Globalflash
(
the
Enron
Europe
newsletter
)
Mike
Late
Jan
sounds
great
.
Meagan
does
have
a
couple
of
big
things
on
the
weekend
in
January
--
National
Charity
League
Senior
Presentation
(
big
dance
that
she
and
I
are
committed
to
help
with
)
,
the
Bearkadette
Ball
and
a
winter
party
for
Cotillion
.
I
believe
that
these
are
three
weekends
in
a
row
,
January
6
,
13
and
20th
.
So
the
last
weekend
in
January
would
work
well
(
and
I
will
need
a
rest
from
formal
affairs
!
)
.
Does
that
work
for
you
?
And
do
you
want
to
do
it
on
a
Saturday
or
Sunday
?
Saturday
probably
works
better
for
me
,
just
so
that
I
am
back
in
Houston
and
doing
laundry
by
Sunday
afternoon
!!
Hi
...
Talked
to
the
little
mother
-
to
-
be
.
She
said
a
shower
would
be
grand
.
She
has
some
big
presentation
mid-January
.
How
does
late
January
sound
to
you
.
Should
we
set
a
date
now
?
Am
I
turning
into
Mother
?
Cindy
I
think
that
it
is
a
great
idea
to
get
some
press
regarding
our
fundamental
operating
standards
,
but
I
wonder
about
the
most
appropriate
timing
,
enough
of
a
global
message
and
the
means
of
delivery
.
On
the
means
of
delivery
,
I
am
not
sure
from
your
note
whether
or
not
I
fully
understand
the
intent
.
Is
there
an
article
to
be
included
in
an
Enron
publication
and
in
addition
is
a
letter
to
be
sent
under
John
's
name
(
if
so
,
to
whom
will
the
letter
be
sent
)
?
Or
is
the
letter
from
John
an
introduction
to
be
included
as
a
lead
in
to
the
article
?
With
regard
to
a
global
message
,
I
think
that
one
of
the
key
points
around
fundamental
operating
standards
are
that
they
are
intended
to
be
global
in
nature
,
applied
to
every
commodity
and
every
location
where
we
engage
in
trading
activities
.
These
global
standards
also
should
enable
Enron
to
expand
its
business
reach
more
quickly
,
with
well
defined
requirements
with
regard
to
trading
operations
.
I
am
not
sure
from
the
article
as
written
that
the
global
nature
of
this
effort
comes
across
.
Finally
,
a
question
regarding
timing
.
The
last
I
knew
after
you
and
Brent
drafted
this
starting
point
for
fundamental
operating
standards
was
that
this
was
being
circulated
(
Shona
took
this
to
do
after
Brent
's
return
to
Houston
)
for
comments
to
all
business
controllers
.
I
do
n't
believe
that
we
are
quite
at
the
point
that
we
can
say
that
all
business
controllers
worldwide
have
reviewed
,
understand
and
have
implemented
these
standards
.
And
not
to
belittle
the
process
of
creating
the
standards
,
the
tough
part
(
and
the
real
meat
behind
this
)
will
be
an
effective
exception
report
on
a
global
basis
against
these
standards
.
My
commitment
to
Rick
Causey
is
that
I
will
have
that
global
report
in
production
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
There
is
much
work
to
do
in
defining
the
content
and
regularity
of
the
report
and
even
more
work
to
do
to
identify
reliable
sources
of
data
for
compiling
the
report
.
Shona
has
commissioned
Mike
Moscoso
to
work
on
this
,
and
I
believe
that
Mike
has
already
been
working
with
James
New
.
So
I
question
whether
or
not
you
want
to
publish
info
about
fundamental
standards
that
we
can
not
yet
report
against
.
Sorry
that
this
response
looks
so
long
.
I
have
been
interrupted
20
times
while
responding
,
so
I
hope
that
it
makes
sense
.
Thanks
for
sharing
this
with
me
.
Since
you
asked
for
input
,
I
hope
that
you
do
n't
mind
that
I
gave
you
some
.

Steve
,
I
noticed
that
our
allocation
from
2000
to
2001
is
going
up
by
21
%
year
on
year
(
ie
)
$
13.9
M
from
$
11.5
M
.
We
have
been
able
to
keep
ENA
's
direct
group
expenses
flat
year
on
year
,
we
are
trying
hard
to
keep
the
corporate
allocation
flat
year
to
year
as
well
.
Do
you
have
a
view
on
how
we
might
be
able
to
achieve
this
goal
?
Regards
Delainey
Do
n't
worry
about
it
...
sorry
for
putting
you
back
on
speaker
.
I
just
wanted
Sue
to
hear
(
she
enjoys
utility
bashing
so
much
)
.
Thanks
for
the
comment
on
the
hearing
.
In
some
respects
I
do
n't
think
the
first
panel
could
have
gone
much
better
;
everyone
thanked
FERC
for
intervening
(
though
for
different
reasons
)
.
The
other
staff
reports
are
also
looking
good
.

Steve
:
At
this
point
,
our
IT
contacts
are
backpedalling
a
bit
and
suggesting
they
can
overcome
the
TIBCO
and
Terminal
Server
problems
.
There
are
still
four
important
issues
,
however
:
IT
still
can
not
commit
to
transferring
messages
across
domains
.
This
means
that
messages
initiated
at
Corp
and
intended
for
the
entire
Enron
organization
will
not
reach
any
business
units
outside
the
Corp
domain
.
No
messages
will
reach
the
EES
organization
unless
IBM
agrees
not
to
use
their
proprietary
message
delivery
tool
,
WebSphere
,
and
will
use
WebLogic
instead
.
WebLogic
is
required
by
BackWeb
,
although
it
is
designed
by
a
separate
company
.
HR
,
intended
to
be
a
key
user
of
this
tool
,
will
not
use
BackWeb
because
survey
responses
can
not
be
made
anonymous
.
HR
has
already
purchased
a
tool
called
CONFIRMIT
that
can
execute
anonymous
surveys
.
Another
thing
to
consider
is
that
these
messages
will
be
set
to
expire
and
disappear
within
a
set
period
of
time
,
meaning
users
can
not
retrieve
them
and
read
them
later
(
as
they
can
with
e-mail
)
.
This
means
that
I
could
be
away
from
the
office
for
several
days
and
miss
a
message
entirely
,
because
it
would
have
expired
and
disappeared
by
the
time
I
returned
.
The
plain
fact
is
that
a
few
members
of
IT
are
pushing
this
initiative
,
but
they
lack
commercial
sponsorship
.
They
are
hoping
Corp
will
foot
the
bill
for
a
pilot
which
will
allow
them
to
fully
test
this
tool
before
implementing
it
company
-
wide
.
Please
let
us
know
if
you
have
additional
questions
.

Should
we

make

How
is
Wednesday
at
2:30
?
I
did
look
at
EOL
and
am
not
surprised
to
see
its
quality
.
I
was
unable
to
say
much
about
it
in
my
Risk
Electricity
Hedging
and
Trading
report
because
of
deadline
pressures
.
How
is
the
site
doing
?
I
am
intrigued
by
the
competition
for
trading
platforms
and
was
astonished
to
hear
that
Goldman
,
Morgan
,
BP
and
Shell
were
going
to
launch
a
site
to
compete
with
yours
.
Talk
about
a
shotgun
marriage
!
If
we
have
time
next
week
,
I
could
step
you
through
our
website
--
www.weathereffects.com
.
I
'm
very
proud
of
what
we
've
done
.
I
ca
n't
give
out
a
password
yet
but
would
be
happy
to
walk
through
the
site
with
you
over
the
phone
using
my
password
.
It
's
a
very
ambitious
site
--
with
state

of
-

WSI
weather
(
seasonal
,
6
-
10
,
and
day

driving
a
good

for
PJM
and
NEPOOL

contributes

price
forecasts
,
capacity
judgments
,
and
"

ideas
to
develop

for

periods
.
After
one
month
's
full
-
bore
effort
,
I
'm
pleased
with
the
results
(
e.g.
,
we
forecast
Nepool
onpeak
to
be
$
43
and
it
turned
out
$
46
)
.
Have
a
great
weekend

what
do
you
think
?
Joe_Lardy@cargill.com
on

10:39:03
AM
Currently
Cargill
and
Enron
have
a
15
MM
collateral
threshold
.
If
possible
,
I
think
the
cleanest
way
to
run
this
biz
would
be
to
put
a
box
around
the
prime
broker
biz
.
We
would
still
operate
under
the
master
isda
but
could
set
up
a
mutually
agreeable
credit
support
annex
for
this
biz
.
We
would
still
keep
the
20,000,000
line
referenced
in
Schedule
B
of
the
POA
agreement
.
The
line
in
the
POA
is
a
seperate
and
distinct
measure
from
the
daily
collateral
.
The
20
mill
reflects
gross
exposure
.
Let
me
know
if
you
think
this
is
reasonable
and
workable
.
We
too
,
are
open
to
suggestion
as
the
Global
and
Enron
relationships
are
very
important
and
a
high
priority
to
us
.
Thanks
Joe
Joe
-
a
few
things
regading
the
POA
/
Cargill
line
..
I
am
going
to
find
out
how
much
line
we
currently
have
available
...
you
probably
already
have
this
.
We
should
allocate
a
piece
to
Global
which
would
solve
the
problem
of
other
Cargill
people
using
the
line
,
putting
us
over
the
limit
,
without
me
knowing
...
We
could
change
the
language
of
the
POA
to
this
...
we
will
not
go
over
Global
's
piece
of
the
Cargill
line
...
I
think
this
would
solve
our
main
concern
...
Please
let
me
know
...
we
are
eager
to
keep
trading
with
Global
and
yourselves
...

I
do
not
think
the
prior
e-mail
got
through
to
Kay
.
Are
either
of
you
familiar
with
this
project
?
We
have
had
no
contact
with
the
ENA
/
Enron
Mexico
commercial
or
legal
people
and
I
do
n't
want
to
bust
any
structuring
goals
.
Our
project
manager
(

and
engineer
(
Harry

want
to
issue
a
tasking
letter
to
procure
engineering
services
on

to
support
the

work
.
I
now
understand
that
someone
at
ENA
/
Enron
Mexico
/
Enron
Wholesale
has
signed
an
EPC
contract
with
ABB
for
this
project

Hello
Janice
:
I
enjoyed
your
recent
e-mail
but
was
sorry
to
hear
about
your
dad
.
It
sounds
as
though
his
health
has
deteriorated
significantly
.
These
are
always
difficult
times
.
But
we
can
be
very
thankful
to
have
such
great
parents
and
to
have
had
the
privilege
to
have
been
raised
in
such
loving
homes
.
Sounds
as
though
Eric
has
done
very
well
as
SMSU
.
He
is
joining
an
excellent
company
.
I
am
also
delighted
to
hear
that
he
will
continue
his
education
working
toward
an
MBA
.
As
to
our
family
,
within
the
last
ten
days
our
youngest
daughter
Elizabeth
was
married
to
a
young
man
from
Buenos
Aires
,
Argentina
.
They
met
while
they
were
both
working
on
a
project
as
lawyers
in
Buenos
Aires
.
They
're
currently
on
their
honeymoon
but
shortly
after
returning
will
be
moving
from
Buenos
Aires
to
Miami
,
Florida
.
This
past
Thursday
night
our
sixth
grandchild
was
born
.
It
was
born
to
our
son
David
and
his
wife
Courtney
.
It
was
a
7
lb.
,
10
oz.
,
20
inch
little
boy
.
So
we
now
have
three
grandsons
and
three
granddaughters
ranging
from
about
2
years
-
4
months
down
to
a
few
days
.
They
are
a
great
deal
of
fun
.
We
are
doing
quite
well
.
I
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
Ginger
"
Rees
"
Copeland
when
she
comes
to
Houston
.
I
would
be
delighted
to
arrange
tickets
for
you
and
your
family
should
you
ever
have
occasion
to
visit
Houston
.
I
hope
you
have
a
great
summer
.
Thank
you
for
your
recent
request
for
Mr.
Lay
to
speak
at
your
conference
.
Unfortunately
,
do
to
Mr.
Lay
's
schedule
he
will
not
be
able
to
participate
.
Thank
you
again
,
Tori

Hi

Makes
me
want
to
race
!!!
I
believe
the
fuel
consumption
will
be
tolerable
as
well
.
Now
,
Debbie
wants
it
.
I
gave
$
16,900
+
tax
.
It
is
very
clean
and
is
Sandalwood
,
Driftwood
or
something
of
that
nature
in
color
.
Almost
silver
.
I
have
to
pick
up
old
gray
over
at
Jerry
's
.
Debbie
said
,
it
is
going
to
be
hard
on
me
to
sale
my
old
dodge
truck
.
I
really
need
to
engage
brain
before
articulating
!
I
am
doing
dirt
work
and
hope
to
plant
ST
Augustine
Grass
by
Friday
before
rain
.
One
thing
is
for
sure
,
the
economy
is
not
faltering
on
my
account
.
Dow
Stock
is
back
up
over
$
33
.
Hooray
,
hoorah
!
Needs
to
go
to
$
41
and
then
I
will
be
happy
.
I
spoke
with
Gerald
and
he
said
there
are
a
bunch
of
folks
hanging
around
Dad
's
place
.
We
need
to
change
the
lock
and
place
posted
signs
at
the
gate
.
I
may
want
to
put
some
steers
or
heifers
up
there
.
I
am
going
up
soon
and
having
the
tractor
fixed
.
Reggie
said
he
will
pay
us
soon
.
He
also
still
wants
the
tractor
if
we
can
hold
on
to
it
.
First
come
,
first
serve
.
When
is
the
wedding
?
We
're
set
for
11/01/01
.
Be
sure
to
take
your
sweety
out
on
the
balcony
tonight
and
gaze
at
the
full
moon
.
It
was
sure
beautiful
coming
up
last
night
.
We
used
to
go
out
and
lay
in
the
pasture
on
a
blanket
and
watch
for
the
space
shuttle
.
Just
jealous
.
My
kid
is
making
wonderful
grades
and
has
reassured
me
she
will
graduate
within
the
four
year
period
.
She
still
has
some
sort
of
scholarship
but
I
am
not
for
sure
how
much
it
pays
.
She
is
going
to
be
a
kinesiologist
,
sports
injury
therapist
.
I
think
she
just
wants
to
be
able
to
touch
football
players
legs
.
She
will
be
20
on
11/03
.
I
am
really
proud
of
her
.
Cindy
said
Jaime
has
grown
up
very
much
.
You
should
e
mail
her
sometimes
.
I
am
sure
she
would
like
to
hear
from
you
.
Jgerma5@aol.com
.
At
any
rate
,
be
careful
and
be
safe
.
You
should
have
listened
to
Maw
,
as
long
as
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
your
pants
zipped
,
you
will
be
alright
.
Shucks
,
guess
none
of
us
three
paid
much
attention
to
that
.
Oh
,
Jeff
Sherrar
has
a
new
book
out
.
Rise
to
Rebellion
.
There
were
some
pretty
cool
dudes
back
around
1774
/
76
.
There
will
be
two
volumes
to
this
saga
.
I
am
half
way
through
the
first
and
you
can
borrow
it
when
I
am
through
.
I
sure
like
his
style
of
writing
.
His
books
are
always
hard
to
put
down
.
After
the
split
Dow
Stock
there
are
120

What
's
happening
?
I
understand
you
have
a
brand
new
truck
.
Must
be
nice
having
money
!!
I
need
2
things
from
you
.
1
.
I
found
the
title
to
the
4
wheeler
and
I
was
going
to
change
it
over
to
you
name
.
What
do
you
think
?
If
that
's
ok
,
how
do
you
want
your
name
to
show
up
on
the
title
and
what
address
should
I
use
?
2
.
I
'm
getting
ready
to
divy
up
the
Dow
stock
.
How
many
of
Dad
's
shares
do
you
have
?
Last
thing
,
send
me
a
million
dollars
,
I
'm
tired
of
working
.
I
thought
we
only
had
cashout
,
at
most
3
times
,
before
this
June
.
I
ca
n't
remember
.
I
do
know
that
most
of
the
time
this
plant
was
not
buring
like
it
did
in
July
and
August
of
this
year
.
I
say
we
just
keep
the
dough
and
go
to
Mexico
.
Hey
guys
,
Would
you
please
ck
the
Oglethorpe
deal
from
July
2000
-
Dec
2000
?
Is
there
supposed
to
be
a
cashout
booked
in
Sitara
for
these
months
?
Oglethorpe
over
paid
their
invoice
every
month
.
I
believe
that
Doug
told
me
the
extra
was
for
the
cashout
that
was
not
invoiced
.
Thanks

Hello
-
I
spoke
with
Jeff
Hodge
yesterday
regarding
the
additional
language
from
Peoples
regarding
Audit
Rights
.
His
initial
reaction
was
that
their
request
was
probably
reasonable
and
in
line
with
the
spirit
of
a
jointly
owned
L.L.C
.
However
,
he
did
suggest
a
couple
slight
revisions
to
protect
Enron
's
interests
.
1
)
Highlighting
that
information
will
only
be
provided
that
is
related
to
enovate
and
2
)
that
each
designated
representative
should
sign
an
appropriate
confidentiality
agreement
.
This
language
has
been
included
in
the
attached
draft
.
My
goal
,
however
optimistic
,
is
to
execute
the
risk
policy
by
the
end
of
today
.
Activity
is
picking
up
dramatically
and
the
fine
line
is
getting
further
blurred
each
passing
day
.
Therefore
,
I
need
to
know
ASAP
if
there
are
any
problems
with
the
draft
as
written
.
Otherwise
,
I
will
be
sending
it
to
Peoples
as
our
final
revision
by
mid
morning
.
Thanks
for
your
prompt
attention
to
this
.

It
is
less
complicated
for
me
to
initial
and
fax
than
to
track
down
someone
who
does
n't
know
anything
about
it
and
get
them
to
initial
it
.
I
can
print
it
here
,
initial
it
,
and
fax
it
to
whomever
you
want
.
Plus
,
I
work
with
Janet
a
lot
so
she
may
get
some
comfort
from
that
,
instead
of
having
a
lawyer
she
has
n't
dealt
with
initial
it
.
She
is
very
conscientious
about
what
she
signs
,
and
who
initials
what
.
Is
the
attached
form
the
final
final
form
?
Where
and
to
whom
do
you
want
it
faxed
?
Thanks

fax
or
someone
else
works

I
'm
working
on
it
now
.
Maybe
we
(
Enron
)
could
review
it
tomorrow
morning
,
then
send
it
to
FCE
.
I
can
meet
around
10:00
.
That
way
,
we
can
get
it
to
them
in
time
for
weekend
review
.
Does
that
work
?
Kay
It
was
good
to
hear
from
you
!
We
had
a
nice
Thanksgiving
here
too
.
It
's
funny
,
because
usually
it
's
just
me
,
Mom
,
Craig
and
Danelia
,
and
Danelia
does
n't
really
like
roasted
turkey
or
roast
beef
(
not
that
she
would
say
it
to
me
!
)
,
so
there
is
not
just
the
same
joy
in
cooking
it
would
be
elsewise
.
It
was
good
having
the
girls
down
.
We
played
a
new
version
of
Uno
called
"
African
Uno
"
that
was
complex
,
fast
and
at
times
,
physically
challenging
.
It
's
not
for
the
meek
.
It
was
incredible
what
a
good
player
Alena
was
.
She
had
her
cards
memorized
as
well
as
everyone
else
s
(
when
you
play
you
'll
see
why
you
can
know
everyone
else
s
hands
!
)
.
I
expect
Craig
did
n't
want
Mom
to
see
his
place
because
it
was
messy
.
I
think
compared
to
my
house
,
he
's
embarrased
about
his
apartment
.
Then
,
also
,
he
's
got
so
much
stuff
in
there
right
now
,
that
I
do
n't
know
how
he
's
going
to
fit
baby
stuff
.
They
would
only
give
him
a
6
month
lease
when
he
renewed
his
lease
last
month
because
they
do
n't
want
3
people
in
that
small
apartment
.
So
he
's
going
to
have
to
start
looking
for
another
place
.
I
guess
Mom
is
going
to
come
back
down
sometime
in
March
or
April
to
see
the
new
baby
.
You
'll
have
to
come
visit
to
check
out
my
new
house
.
The
upstairs
"
guest
suite
"
is
pretty
neat
.
It
's
got
its
own
bathroom
and
tv
,
and
is
pretty
cozy
.
As
far
as
the
call
with
Uncle
Ben
goes
,
if
he
was
thrilled
to
hear
from
me
I
could
n't
tell
by
his
voice
.
It
was
a
pretty
stilted
conversation
for
both
of
us
.
But
,
I
guess
,
it
's
a
start
...
I
've
already
made
my
XMAS
plans
.
I
leave
the
evening
of
the
21st
,
my
flight
comes
in
about
10
pm
,
and
leave
the
morning
of
the
27th
at
6
am
.
It
's
good
chatting
with
you
.
Keep
in
touch
!

Attached
is
the
referenced
agreement
.
Let
me
know
if
the
notice
information
is
OK
with
you
.
If
so
,
I
'll
get
it
signed
by
Craig
Breslau
today
,
then
bring
it
to
you
for
countersignature
.
Thinking
about
that
,
what
's
your
title
?
I
'm
not
sure
you
have
the
authority
to
sign
documents
w/o
special
authority
...
No
,
it
does
not
mean
that
.
Adding
all
the
Enron
"
Specified
Entities
"
would
only
make
a
default
under
a
financial
transaction
with
those
other
Enron
entities
a
default
under
this
agreement
.
Our
concern
is
that
we
do
n't
want
any
trading
related
defaults
to
ever
trigger
a
default
under
a
loan
transaction
which
has
a
swap
as
a
component
.

If
you
do
add
all
the
entities
,
does
that
mean
that
we
would
not
need
to
put
in
place
a
separate
agreement
for
ECCL
?
With
respect
to
Deutsche
Bank
(
""
DB
"
)
,
we
have
one
credit
issue
remaining
,
DB
would
like
us
to
add
all
the
Enron
trading
entities
DB
trades
with
as
Specified
Entities
under
the
ISDA
Master
Agreement
and
we
are
somewhat
hesitant
to
do
so
,
as
this
could
potentially
roll
up
swaps
under
structured
loan
transactions
into
a
default
under
the
ISDA
Agreement
.
Sara
and
Bill
Bradford
in
Credit
are
supposed
to
talk
to
the
DB
Credit
people
about
this
remaining
issue
.
With
respect
to
First
Union
National
Bank
,
the
draft
we
were
working
from
was
so
old
that
they
agreed
to
look
at
our
current
form
of
agreement
which
was
sent
to
them
on
11/8/00
for
review
.
Sara
is
working
on
that
with
Susan
Bailey
,
another
paralegal
in
our
Group
.

I
spoke
to
Mark
Taylor
about
your
signing
authority
,
and
he
agrees
that
you
do
not
have
the
authority
to
execute
documents
on
your
own
,
but
as
long
as
you
are
only
co-signing
documents
signed
by
an
authorized
officer
as
a
control
measure
we
're
OK
.
Susan
,
Joe
,
The
referenced
TAGG
#
was
entered
as
a
'
New
Counterparty
'
,
can
you
please
let
me
know
what
counterparty
this
is
so
we
can
correctly
assess
the
counterparty
exposure
.
Thank
you
,
Russell
Hey
there
yourself
,
Sorry
I
have
n't
written
you
guys
in
a
while
to
keep
you
properly
updated
.
I
am
indeed
checking
on
flights
to
Seoul
and
do
n't
think
I
'm
going
to
go
at
exactly
the
same
time
as
my
parents
.
As
much
fun
as
they
are
,
I
figured
we
would
probably
do
some
different
things
than
what
you
have
planned
for
them
.
As
for
Ted
,
things
are
still
going
well
although
I
have
n't
see
him
at
all
this
week
(
we
are
two
very
busy
people
)
.
But
,
we
had
a
great
laid
back
day
last
Saturday
and
I
think
have
hit
that
comfortable
stage
...
you
know
,
not
quite
so
formal
about
dates
etc
.
In
one
sense
it
's
great
,
but
it
also
makes
things
a
lot
harder
to
read
.
Anyway
,
I
'm
sure
my
Mom
told
you
guys
but
Travis
and
Kathy
got
to
meet
him
and
I
think
it
went
well
.
Hopefully
,
if
we
're
still
dating
come
December
,
you
and
Chuck
can
meet
him
when
you
come
back
to
visit
.
I
'm
planning
on
dragging
him
to
at
least
one
of
the
U.T.
games
,
I
just
have
to
find
out
when
he
wants
to
go
(
as
well
as
properly
prepare
him
for
the
Scott
/
Kelley
/
Parks
/
Wild
Card
gang
and
the
full
-
day
affair
that
is
a
U.T.
game
)
.
Things
in
Houston
are
good
and
definitely
warm
.
I
went
with
Emily
and
her
Mom
last
night
to
see
the
musical
"
Rent
"
and
it
was
wonderful
.
Also
,
I
'm
going
out
to
San
Diego
for
the
Labor
Day
weekend
to
visit
Hoot
's
daughter
Julie
.
Needless
to
say
I
am
very
excited
.
Talk
to
you
guys
soon
,
Susan
Hey
girlie
,
How
are
you
doing
?
Have
n't
heard
from
you
in
a
while
.
A
little
birdie
told
me
that
you
were
checking
into
tickets
for
Seoul
.
Are
you
really
?
Would
you
come
with
your
parents
or
separately
?
In
any
case
,
we
have
had
some
more
time
to
do
some
exploring
(
and
shopping
)
,
so
we
have
some
good
ideas
about
what
to
do
if
you
come
.
I
think
that
we
will
stay
in
Korea
when
your
parents
come
and
do
the
whole
base
thing
(
which
will
take
only
a
few
minutes
,
actually
)
,
but
are
considering
going
to
China
or
somewhere
during
part
of
Thanksgiving
.
We
'll
do
whatever
you
want
want
if
you
still
are
coming
!
Let
us
know
the
latest
with
Ted
and
also
with
what
's
going
on
in
Houston
.
Take
care
,
Chris

Hey
Tonto
(
a.k.a
-
the
trusty
,
but
silent
,
side
-
kick
to
the
Lone
Ranger
or
in
this
case
the
Big
D
)
The
play
was
very
good
and
I
think
well
received
.
I
'd
forgotten
how
blown
away
I
was
by
some
of
the
songs
the
first
time
I
saw
it
in
NY
.
The
cast
members
really
have
to
have
incredibly
powerful
voices
to
pull
off
a
few
of
the
most
poignant
numbers
(
I
think
this
could
be
your
true
calling
)
.
I
caught
the
third
day
of
Corey
's
Jeopardy
run
last
night
here
at
the
office
(
yes
,
I
had
to
come
back
after
the
play
...
I
love
my
job
!
)
.
Anyway
,
I
'm
sure
I
'd
mentioned
it
before
but
yes
she
is
a
very
smart
girl
.
As
a
result
of
that
,
she
has
managed
on
several
occasions
over
the
years
to
detract
from
my
enjoyment
of
playing
Trivial
Pursuit
or
watching
Jeopardy
by
absolutely
obliterating
me
(
The
girl
actually
did
her
senior
thesis
on
Trivia
)
.
Kori
told
me
she
saw
you
last
night
at
Steak
Night
and
introduced
herself
since
I
failed
to
do
so
the
last
time
we
went
.
I
should
let
you
know
though
that
she
was
very
offended
this
morning
that
you
did
n't
spell
her
name
right
in
the
email
-
I
mean
it
's
such
a
common
spelling
.
So
was
Darren
there
last
night
to
meet
her
or
do
you
just
think
they
'd
make
a
good
match
?
She
's
a
very
fun
girl
.
Hope
you
day
is
going
well
and
that
the
move
to
30
went
off
without
a
hitch
.
Shorty
--
Due
to
the
lack
of
response
yesterday
,
I
'm
beginning
to
worry
about
your
success
with
the
road
test
...
I
'm
going
to
assume
that
you
did
n't
get
around
to
it
.

How
was
the
play
?
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
I
saw
your
friend
on
a
re-run
Jeopardy
the
other
night
and
I
almost
called
you
but
it
came
on
at
11:30
.
Smart
girl
.
I
ran
into
Corey
last
night
at
LW
s
and
I
am
thinking
this
is
a
girl
for
Darren
.
I
'll
talk
to
you
later
.
Maybe
you
should
ignore
the
sentiment
of
the
quote
I
sent
earlier
...
I
think
you
may
be
adhering
to
it
too
faithfully
.
At
this
rate
we
may
have
to
start
pinning
notes
to
your
shirt
to
remind
you
to
do
things
.
However
,
having
driven
with
you
on
several
occasions
I
feel
confident
you
will
be
able
to
pass
the
test
with
flying
colors
.
Keep
in
mind
though
that
if
you
end
up
failing
I
will
not
let
you
forget
it
(
and
,
as
we
have
established
,
I
have
the
memory
of
an
elephant
)
.
I
'll
keep
discussion
of
me
to
a
minimum
and
just
say
that
things
are
well
on
32
.
Now
back
to
what
's
really
important
...
you
.

...
I
just
found
out
that
I
need
to
take
the
TX
driver
s
exam
both
written
and
on
the
rode
.
This
is
a
two
day
process
and
all
because
I
let
my
CA
license
expire
.
I
know
I
need
some
of
your
organizational
skills
.
I
may
try
to
run
out
and
take
the
test
this
afternoon
while
I
get
moved
to
30
(
I
better
not
fail
it
)
.
How
's
life
on
32
today
--
well
that
's
enough
about
you
let
's
talk
more
about
me
.
There
is
no
pleasure
in
having
nothing
to
do
;
the
fun
is
in
having
lots
to
do
and
not
doing
it
.

I

they

another

once

Do
you

Do

Does
it
make

for
us
to
set
up
a
meeting
with
you
participating
from
Buenos

?
I
'm

we
have
much
to

at

-
actually
,
I
'm
sure
I
do

Further
background
:
Argentina
intend
to
press
ahead
even
given
the
concern
about
taxes
,
etc
.
They
wish
to
launch
on
Sept.
1
-
meaning
we
will
need
to
be
sending
mailings
sometime
around
mid-August

If
you
need
more
,
there
is
a
proposal
from
the
documentation
committee
for
a
new
alternative
for
calculating
termination
amounts
(
we
heard
about
it
in
Amsterdam
)
that
I
think
will
be
particularly
attractive
to
the
energy
markets
.
I
do
n't
know
where
this
stands
officially
(
I
have
n't
heard
any
developments
since
Amsterdam
)
but
I
can
find
out
from
Bob
Pickle
if
you
want
.

Glad
to
hear
that
they
are
all
healthy
and
were
a
good
size
,
and
that
Mom
is
doing
well
.
Look
forward
to
seeing
pictures
of
the
little
ones
.
I
know
you
all
are
going
to
have
so
much
fun
with
them
.
Hope
you
've
been
storing
up
sleep
,
cause
it
looks
like
you
wo
n't
be
getting
much
for
a
while
.
These
three
little
ones
do
n't
realize
how
lucky
they
are
to
have
such
a
nice
Dad
,
but
I
'm
sure
they
'll
find
out
soon
.
Take
care
Marie
This
is
just
to
let

Emma
gave
birth
at

on
Friday
,
6th
July
,
to
our
triplets
:
Toby
William
-
12.46
pm
-
4
lbs
Although
small
,
they
are
all
"
fully
functioning
"
and
very
well
-
they
are
in
the
lowest
level
of
special
care
(
and
they
will
probably
be
in
there
for
another
two
to
four
weeks
)
until
they
can
feed
properly
and
maintain
their
weights
.
Emma
is
fine
,
too
-
very
well

Hi
everyone
,
Does
this
mean
that
for
June
and
for
a
certain
portion
of
July
we
should
not
do
anything
and
just
make
adjustments
on
a
going
forward
basis
(
and
assume
everything
will
work
out
at
month
end
)
?
If
this
is
the
case
I
would
like
someone
to
walk
me
through
June
to
see
if
the
numbers
did
really
work
themselves
out
as
there
was
a
large
swing
in
second
order
on
June
29
that
was
not
adjusted
for
.
Let
me
know
if
one
of
you
could
help
me
do
this
.
Karim
.
Evidently
,
this
a
problem
that
Stacey
White
has
been
aware
of
for
a
couple
of
months
now
.
There
was
a
change
made
in
the
coding
for
the
delta
position
and
this
has
somehow
messed
up
the
liq
value
.
John
John

flipping
problem
for

that
's
causing
this
whole
issue
.
I
'll

you

'll

(

The
post
id
I
am
looking
at
for
Calgary
is
11608
.
I
am
looking
at
the
option
liquidation
report

all
of
the
$
65
puts
are
in
the
money
and
the
$
75
call
is
also
in
the
money
.
Should
n't
all
the
liquidation
values
from
the
beginning
of
the
month
be
a
negative
(
representing
positive
liquidation
)
for
the
puts
?
The
liq
value
for
the
call
is
CORRECT
.
John
Karim
,
I
do
n't
want
to
wait
till
month
end
,
let
's
adjust
the
numbers
now
and
for
the
June
29
2nd
order
,
let
s
take
that
value
into
June
since
it
relates
to
July
puts
.

Jeff
I
'll
believe
it

.
Thanks

)
and
I
've
got
some
follow

up
as
well
based
on
chats
I
had
in

afternoon
on

with

Attached
is
a
rough
draft
of
my
talking
points
for
a
panel
I
'll
be
on
at
a
CEM
conference
in
SF
on
Thursday
afternoon
.
Have
distributed
to
Western
GA
team
(
plus
Steffes
)
for
comment
and
thought
you
may
have
some
,
too
.
Goal
is
to
(
politely
?
)
refute
Loretta
Lynch
's
and
Carl
Woods
'
continued
assertions
that
1
)
California
's
move
to
deregulate
was
based
solely
on
ideology
with
no
basis
in
fact
and
2
)
the
solution
is
to
turn
back
the
clock
to
command
-
and
-
control
regulation
.
The
FERC
order
tomorrow
is
likely
to
alter
the
points
somewhat
.
Comments
are
much
appreciated
.
Jeff
Chris
:
As
we
discussed
yesterday
,
Laird
and
I
spoke
and
we
think
that
the
presentation
is
good
to
go
for
Thursday
.
We
'll
need
to
update
the
numbers
for
the
offer
we
made
to
S.D.
last
week
.
You
had
mentioned
that
you
might
want
to
include
a
shaped
product
.
You
still
considering
it
?
Let
us
know
and
we
can
add
it
,
and
make
any
other
changes
you
'd
like
to
make
at
this
end
.
My
flight
gets
into
S.D.
at
at
8:35
on
southwest
.
Jeff
Sandi
sez
it
's
actually
happening
at
10
AM
and
it
's
renewable
-
focused
.

Dear
Justin
Marly
asked
me
to
respond
to
you
.
As
you
know
,
the
suffix
ONLINE
is
purely
descriptive
and
now
used
by
many
companies
.
Therefore
,
any
trade
mark
registration
that
incorporates
the
word
ONLINE
as
a
suffix
in
the
way
that
you
use
it
will
not
enable
its
owner
to
prevent
others
from
using
the
word
ONLINE
.
Given
the
above
,
if
you
have
adequate
protection
for
the
word
ENRON
(
which
covers
the
services
that
you
offer
on
-
line
as
well
as
your
core
activities
)
,
I
'd
say
that
another
application
for
the
words
ENRON
ONLINE
is
probably
unnecessary
.
However
,
if
you
use
a
particular
logo
for
the
on
-
line
service
,
that
should
be
registered
.
I
hope
the
above
is
clear
.
Jonathan
Day
Marly

If
you
could
respond
to
me
on
this
request
,
thanks

Can
one
of
you
give
me
a
quick
call
to
discuss
.
I
'm
@
X37047
.
Thanks
.
I
believe
we
are
to
some
extent
already
protected
with
"
Enron
"
proceeded
with
anything
,
but
EnronOnline
(
TM
)
,
etc.
just
affords
us
more
protection
.
I
assume
this
is
akin
to
why
McDonald
's
trademarks
"
Mc
"
Everything
?
David
Forster

Paul
,
Can
you
please
give
me
a
call
to
discuss
trademarking
?
i.e.
Are
we
covered
if
we
proceed
a
word
with
"
Enron
"
?
e.g.
:
EnronEAuction
.
If
we
are
covered
,
then
was
it
necessary
to
register
EnronOnline
?
Thanks
,
Dave

Per
my
conversation
with
Edmund
this
morning
,
we
are
moving
the
following
countries
to
the
non-approved
list
:
Austria
,
Belgium
,
Croatia
,
Czech
Republic
,
Denmark
,
Poland
,
Portugal
,
Romania
,
Singapore
,
and
Slovenia
.
Below
is
the
list
,
now
updated
to
reflect
this
change
.
For
banks
incorporated
in
a
non-approved
jurisdiction
,
it
may
be
possible
for
them
to
trade
out
of
a
branch
located
in
an
approved
jurisdiction
(
i.e.
U.S.
and
U.K.
branches
)
.
This
would
have
to
be
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis
.
Please
let
me
know
if
there
are
any
changes
to
this
list
.

Why
does
it
always
have
to
be
my
deals
...?!!!
It
would
be
nice
if
Shankman
and
John
Arnold
could
attend
.
Perhaps
you
can
give
them
a
personal
invitation
...
We
have
received
the
amendment
to
the
BC
Gas
ISDA
Master
executed
by
BC
Gas
,
which
adds
the
Canadian
Securities
Representation
,
so
we
do
n't
have
to
add
the
rep
into
every
confirm
.
BC
Gas
wo
n't
sign
the
confirms
with
the
rep
in
,
and
this
has
caused
much
difficulties
.
I
am
going
to
count
it
as
signed
,
since
BC
Gas
has
signed
,
but
we
still
need
it
to
be
signed
by
ECC
.
Can
you
get
it
signed
ASAP
and
back
to
me
.
Much
thanks
.

Susan

,

I
'll

I
'll
come
around

show
you
how

I
spoke
to
Edmund
to
get
the
scoop
on
what
we
are
going
to
be
doing
on
the
confirms
for
Credit
Derivatives
,
and
he
said
that
his
current
understanding
is
that
all
of
the
confirms
will
be
done
out
of
London
.
I
communicated
that
to
Bob
Bowen
.
He
also
said
that
London
was
going
to
be
hiring
120
people
to
deal
with
the

In
summary
the
planned
systems
changes
and
manual
substantiation
efforts
are
behind
schedule
.
Additional
resources
are
being
allocated
and
the
situation
is
being
closely
monitored
(
both
for

end
signoff
and
on
going

The
intention
of
the
efforts
and
actions
documented
in
my
earlier
update
(
see
attached
email
)
was
to
provide
a
robust
position
signoff
process
for
total
metal
tonnage
,
spread
and
brand
and
location
a
timely
substantiation
of
stock
on
balance
sheet
forward
MTM
debtors
and
creditor
balances
OBSF
transactional
values
and
a
reconciliation
of
the
barclays
intercompany
account
Consequently
I
need
to
inform
you
of
,
and
/
or
require
your
approval
for
,
the
following
:
I
will
discuss
with
AA
the
following
that
OBSF
values
within
the
extended
trial
balance
may
be
misstated
due
to
data
issues
(
above
and
beyond
existing
conversations
with
AA
on
model
simplifications
)
an
outline
of
the
internal
balance
sheet
review
process
described
in
my
earlier
note
which
must
now
be
reprioritised
and
rescoped
(
see
MO
work
)
The
signoff
for
additional
permanent
'
Enron
'
headcount
who
will
'
duplicate
'
certain
key
position
control
processes
ultimately
replacing
some
existing
Traffic
staff
A
reconciling
difference
of
$
15
mm
exists
between
the
reported
DPR
and
the
final
accounting
p&l
as
generated
on
the
AS400
.
We
will
continue
to
investigate
potential
misstatements
in
the
system
p&l
,
as
a
result
of
data
or
system
valuation
problems
,
within
the
month
end
reporting
timeframe
.
However
,
this
difference
may
need
to
be
adjusted
for
following
a
final
review
and
signoff
of
system
p&l
values
with
traders
.
The
recall
of
all
OBSF
stock
in
early
April
and
retention
on
balance
sheet
(
reduced
where
economically
viable
)
until
positions
are
fully
reconciled
and
repeatable
daily
signoff
process
can
be
instigated
.
Middle
Office
work
being
prioritised
is
as
follows
the
stock
circularisation
initiated
for
close
of
business
23rd
-
with
full
reconciliation
of
returns
to
current
system
data
by
traffic
/
co-ordination
an
audit
of
the
stock
and
forward
valuation
report
for
the
30th
(
replacing
planned
23rd
review
due
to
system
issues

Complexities
surrounding
the
operation
of
the
Off
Balance
Sheet
Facility
(
"
OBSF
"
)
which
commenced
two
weeks
before
the
year
end
.
The
uncertainty
generated
by
the
revocation
of
AA
's
signoff
for
the
facility
late
in
the
year
end
audit
.
The
discovery
of
a
number
of
'
bugs
'
within
the
AS400
Merchanting
code
,
arising
from
the
release
of
OBSF
designed
functionality
,
which
compounded
the
operational
burden
of
supporting
the
OBSF
.
The
requirement
to
amend
the
operational
process
and
OBSF
IT
code
as
a
result
of
the
current
renegotiation
of
the
OBSF
with
Barclays
(
and
AA
)
.
The
senior
IT
developer
for
Merchanting
has
resigned
and
been
sent
on
gardening
leave
.
The
Corporate
requirement
to
lower
working
capital
usage
for
the
Merchanting
business
irrespective
of
the
above
parochial
business
issues
.
Various
mitigating
actions
have
been
taken
and
will
be
taken
to
provide
focus
,
gain
comfort
over
control
levels
and
to
provide
assurance
to
senior
management
as
to
the
accuracy
of
the
Q1
DPR
and
business
balance
sheet
.
The
implementation
for
SAP
for
the
Merchanting
business
has
been
delayed
and
effectively
decoupled
from
the
higher
risk
(
higher
benefit
)
Brokerage
implementation
-
benefit
is
to
provide
sole
focus
on
OBSF
for
IT
Merchanting
developers
.
The
AR
/
AP
SAP
data
quality
reviews
for
both
businesses
are
continuing
so
as
to
provide
a
detailed
analysis
as
at
end
Q1
.
The
necessary
report
functionality
should
be
available
within
the
AS400
,
however
contingencies
have
been
initiated
to
build
tactical
VBA
/
excel
reports
outside
of
the
AS400
but
using
AS400
data
downloads
.
User
requests
for
additional
AS400
functionality
and
reports
have
been
aggressively
prioritised
and
a
code
freeze
will
commence
prior
to
the
end
of
Q1
following
the
delivery
of
three
reports
determined
as
minimum
requirements
for
the
support
of
OBSF
.
A
resubstantiation
of
the
full
Q1
DPR
will
be
completed
by
the
Risk

staff
reconciling
the
full

Dr.
Harris
:
I
would
like
to
thank
you
for
personally
taking
the
time
to
closely
review
my
application
.
Though
I
am
disappointed
with
the
results
I
am
still
determined
to
attend
The
TEXAS
Graduate
School
of
Business
next
year
.
I
understand
how
competitive
the
process
has
become
,
but
I
felt
that
with
my
work
experiences
,
recommendations
,
personality
,
extracurricular
activities
,
etc.
that
this
would
compensate
for
my
disability
.
I
also
plan
on
retaking
the
GMAT
test
.
Due
to
my
disability
,
this
will
be
a
monumental
task
;
but
I
am
determined
to
prove
to
the
Committee
that
I
can
be
successful
at
The
TEXAS
Graduate
School
of
Business
.
I
would
like
to
come
down
to
Austin
this
spring
to
meet
with
you
to
further
discuss
my
application
file
and
to
personally
meet
you
.
If
you
think
of
anything
else
I
can
do
to
strengthen
my
overall
application
file
for
next

,
please
let
me
know

Take

hope
to
hear
from
you

,
that

It

Thanks
Ben
Please
send
me
an
excel
spreadsheet
which
depicts
the
value
that
you
see
associated
with
the
heat
rate
spread
option
.
I
want
to
make
sure
that
I
understand
exactly
how
you
propose
valuing
the
transaction
and
how
this
value
would
be
booked
.
As
such
,
please
provide
the
following
detail
:
Will
we
be
valuing
/
booking
a
series
of
monthly
call
options
or
a
series
of
daily
call
options
?
What
power
curve
are
we
valuing
the
deal
against
-
PJM
East
or
West
Hub
?
Please
send
me
the
current
fuel
curve
that
you
are
converting
to
$
/
MWh
to
value
the
deal
?
What
expiration
date
are
you
using
,
i.e.
:
for
monthly
call
options
the
15th
of
the
relevant
month
,
and
for
daily
options
?
What
correlation
are
you
assuming
,
15
%
flat
for
twenty
years
?
Are
you
deducting
all
operating
expenses
from
the
value
of
the
option
?
Are
you
using
the
"
SPRDOPT
"
Exotic
Options
function
to
value
the
option
?
Are
you
using
the
$
/
MWh
VOM
dollar
amount
as
your
strike
?
Has
Don
provided
the
fixed
payment
stream
?
This
stream
should
be
covering
both
P&I
and
not
just
principal
.
Yvan
,
and
Ben
,
please
provide
answers
to
these
question
via
written
correspondence
so
that
their
is
limited
probability
of
misunderstanding
.
Thank
you
both
very
much
for
your
time
and
help
thus
far
.
Furthermore
,
I
would
like
to
reiterate
that
RAC
's
goal
,
prior
to
quoting
any
credit
reserve
,
is
to
be
100
%
confident
that
:
(
i
)
the
methodology
that
is
being
employed
is
consistent
among
the
internal
groups
;
and
(
ii
)
the
inherent
value
of
the
price
risk
management
contracts
matches
.
This
enables
RAC
to
manage
the
associated
risk
during
the
life
of
the
transaction
both
effectively
and
appropriately
.
Regards
,
Christopher
Randy
,
this
is
the
issue
I
left
you
the
voice
mail
on
.
We
had
a
pretty
good
idea
when
we
signed
the
contract
that
ECS
would
not
be
able
to
complete
that
by
the
contract
start
date
,
so
we
negotiated
a
fall
back
plan
under
which
ECS
is
obligated
to
"
assist
[
Transwestern
]
in
developing
a
manual
system
to
accomplish
the
same
result
and
will
hold
harmless
and
keep
[
Transwestern
]
whole
for
all
cost
and
expenses
"
associated
with
the
manual
system
.
We
will
fight
with
them
about
who
owes
the
$
200
k
that
James
mentions
below
based
on
their
failure
to
"
assist
"
us
in
managing
the
cost
.
In
the
mean
time
,
we
need
to
make
sure
that
we
are
doing
everything
we
can
to
get
a
handle
on
the
situation
to
mitigate
future
costs
.
Do
we
have
someone
who
is
watching
this
out
there
?
We
are
running
so
full
tilt
on
TW
that
we
may
not
have
as
much
flexibiltiy
to
manage
this
situation
as
we
expected
,
but
let
me
know
what
we
can
do
.
James
had
heard
that
one
hold
up
was
the
absence
of
a
confidentiality
agreement
--
I
guess
between
ECS
and
Transwestern
--
that
would
permit
ECS
to
communicate
to
us
the
details
on
how
to
access
teh
key
info.
from
CDEC
.
That
sounds
like
a
BS
excuse
from
ECS
,
but
it
that
's
what
they
are
saying
,
let
me
know
and
we
can
figure
out
a
solution
.
Thanks
.

Would
you
please
contact
Gerald
Nemec
and
review
the
Gallup
Compression
Service
Contract
in
respect
to
the
Load
Control
Management
.
My
understanding
was
that
ECS
was
to
provide
a
means
to
access
CDEC
's
online
profile
in
order
for
us
to
make
a
decision
to
avoid
running
the
compressor
during
CDEC
's
peak
load
periods
.
We
have
not
received
access
to
this
information
which
has
resulted
so
far
in
additional
electric
cost
of
$
200,987.33
for
the
period
of
July
through
September
.
Additional
cost
will
be
incurred
for
the
remainder
of
this
year
,
that
I
have
not
been
able
to
review
yet
.
This
cost
is
averaging
$
79,000
per
month
if
we
continue
to
run
the
compressor
as
we
have
in
August
and
September
.
Good
point
,
but
I
'm
comfortable
we
're
covered
because
our
bidders
were
all
bidding
on
a
chunk
of
capacity
and
primary
points
.
They
are
deemed
to
be
on
notice
that
they
had
alternate
point
rights
(
it
s
in
the
tariff
)
and
if
they
wanted
to
submit
a
bid
that
had
a
different
rate
for
primaries
and
alternates
,
they
could
have
done
so
.
None
of
them
did
,
and
most
importantly
,
the
winning
bidders
did
not
.
Our
letter
agreement
simply
memorializes
that
we
will
charge
the
same
negotiated
rate
whether
the
gas
flows
on
primaries
or
alternates
.
I
assume
from
your
message
you
are
OK
with
this
and
they
can
get
it
nailed
down
?
DF
I
just
got
done
looking
at
the
underlying
contract
language
as
set
forth
in
the
pro
forma
service
agreement
in
the
tariff
and
it
specifically
says
that
the
max
rate
would
apply
unless
a
discount
or
negotiated
rate
has
been
agreed
to
.

After
discussions
with

group
I
propose
that
that
redlined
language
be
added
to
the
attached
Dynegy
agreement
and
to
the
4
other
negotiated
rate
agreements
we
've
done
.
If
there

you
need
to
get

ASAP

In
discussion
with
Dave
,
we
thought
it
would
be
good
to
put
this
together
in
a
format
of
questions
and
answers
.
However
,
as
you
will
see
,
the
questions
I
thought
of
got
kinda
long
-
but
I
think
we
need
answers
for
all
of
them
.
One
thought
is
to
have
just
the
agenda
as
a
couple
topics
and
then
lead
in
with
the
first
two
questions
as

designed
to
help
with
back
problems
,
which
she
has
.
Many
people
at
Enron
already
have
this
type
of
chair
,
but
we
rarely
,
if
ever
,
have
a
surplus
because
they
are
so
popular
.
The
cost
is
$
567.77
per
chair
plus
tax
.
Please
approve
the
purchase
of
two
.
Thanks
!
I
believe
you
got
a
copy
of
the
John
Sommer
letter
to
producers
dated
Jan
6
that
MKM
's
spies
intercepted
.
She
forwarded
the
Sommer
letter
to
Stan
and
discussed
it
with
him
.
Dari
and
I
vented
our
aggravation
by
drafting
the
attached
letter
to
Gibson
and
Kyle
complaining
of
Sommer
's
duplicity
,
but
after
tempers
cooled
,
MKM
and
I
decided
not
to
send
it
to
Stan
or
urge
him
to
send
a
written
response
.
As
it
stands
,
MKM
and
I
will
probably
bring
it
up
with
Sommer
in
OK
City
and
strongly
suggest
the
importance
of
coordinated
communication
to
the
producers
.
Stan
may
also
bring
the
letter
up
orally
next
time
he
's
on
the
phonne
with
Gibson
or
Kyle
as
an
example
of
how
not
to
handle
this
situation
.
Yea
--
it
was
outstanding
news
!
What
a
hoss
.
Ca
n't
catch
you
this
time
but
14721
keep
me
posted
on
your
next
trip
.

Who
is
responsible
for
completing
all
paperwork
for
entering
a
new
market
?
Is
it
someone
on
your
team
or
someone
from
CEC
?
There
have
been
some
issues
with
getting
everything
coordinated

Jean
&
Thane
--
Can
we
have
a
meeting
this
week
(
maybe
Thursday
at
3:30
)
to
discuss
this
?
Jim
We
do
need
a
formal
plan
.
We
have
been
working
closely
together
to
identify
the
issues
as
they
develop
and
propose
solutions
.
Doug
has
been
providing
us
with
the
necessary
specific
market
information
.
We
have
been
successful
in
communicating
that
information
to
the
new
commissioners
and
Ercot
and
seeking
resolution
.
The
commission
is
definitely
more
responsive
to
market
participants
that
are
articulating
the
issue
,
providing
specific
examples
and
proposing
the
solution
.
Grand
-
standing
is
ignored
.
Doug
and
I
met
with
the
Chairman
of
PUCT
and
have
had
subsequent
conversations
.
Thane
and
I
also
visited
with
him
.
Pat
Wood
made
a
phone
call
to
Tom
Noel
and
told
him
to
get
the
Texas
market
fixed
.
(
Even
though
he
has
bigger
things
to
do
in
D.C.
,
this
is
his
legacy
and
he
recognizes
that
if
deregulation
does
not
work
in
Texas
,
the
repercussions
could
be
global
.
)
Chairman
Sibley
and
Chairman
Wolens
(
of
the
Texas
legislature
)
are
also
engaged
in
market
developments
.
We
have
been
working
with
the
State
Affairs
legislative
committee
and
keeping
them
apprised
.
There
is
an
Electric
Restructuring
Committee
hearing
scheduled
for
September
6th
or
7th
.
The
forum
is
expected
to
be
invited
testimony
only
.
Those
currently
listed
as
invitees
are
PUCT
Commissioners
and
Ercot
's
Sam
Jones
and
Tom
Noel
.
The
hearing
is
focused
on
the
pilot
and
we
have
an
opportunity
to
provide
some
probing
questions
for
Wolens
to
direct
to
Sam
and
Tom
.
Now
that
Sibley
is
not
a
candidate
for
Lt.
Governor
,
there
is
more
freedom
to
open
up
and
ask
some
difficult
questions
.
Thane
is
in
Austin
on
Friday
,
but
is
available
by
phone
.
I
will
be
on
a
plane
to
Houston
at
8:00
a.m
.
Can
we
find
another
time
that
works
for
us
to
meet
?
Thane
is
in
an
Ercot
PRS
meeting
Friday
from
9:30
until
3:00
.
I
am
available
after
Rick
's
Friday
budget
meeting
...
are
you
available
then
?
You
are
right
,
we
do
need
a
formal
plan
,
Thane
has
started
an
initial
draft
.
Thanks
,
Jean
Jean

Thane

Walking
out
last
night
,
Kevin
Presto
indicated
that
there
were
games
being
played
in
ERCOT
with
the
new
market
rules
and
prices
in
certain
markets
were
not
reflective
of
working
markets
.
If
ERCOT
goes
the
way
of
California
-
either
due
to
market
power
or
poor
market
design
rules
-
it
will
be
a
bad
day
for
deregulation
and
for
Pat
Wood
.
As
important
,
the
new
PUCT
Commissioners
need
some
help
right
now
in
messaging
the
market
.
Let
's
get
them
to
support
constructive
solutions
that
will
make
a
real
difference
.
Jean
and
Thane
,
I
think
that
we
need
a
FORMAL
PLAN
on
what
to
do
over
the
next
3
-
6
months
to
leverage
this
situation
.
I
would
like
to
discuss
this
with
you
on
Friday
am
.
I
am
free
at
8
am
on
Friday
before
Rick
's
budget
meeting
.
Jim
FYI
.
You
may
want
to
discuss
with
Becky
.
Jim
We
envision
a
format
that
would
provide
a
brief
summary
and
analysis
of
the
order
,
filing
,
etc.
with
a
link
to
the
source
document
as
well
for
those
who
would
like
more
detailed
information
.
This
would
replace
the
paper
copies
you
and
your
people
are
currently
getting
.
Many
details
remain
to
be
worked
out
,
but
we
will
keep
you
advised
.
In
the
meantime
,
could
you
please
provide
a
contact
on
your
side
with
whom
we
could
discuss
technical
issues
?
What
do
I
need
to
do
?

for

the
resume
of
Peter
Percell
who
has
an
extensive
experience
in
modeling
physical
flows
of
natural
gas
in
pipeline
systems
.
Peter
is
looking
currently
for
a
job
.
I
met
him
last
week
at
the
meeting
of
the
Science
and
Industry
Advance
with
Mathematics
society
at
the
University
of
Houston
.
The
application
of
recent
developments
in
optimization
theory
and
numerical
methods
can
help
Enron
to
improve
further
efficiency
of
our
pipeline
system
and
reduce
the
consumption
of
compressor
fuel
.
Please
,
let
me
know
if
you
interested
in
introducing
Peter
to
executives
in
your
organization
.
I
shall
be
glad
to
make
arrangements
for
an
interview

I
enjoyed
your
presentation
,
and
meeting
you
briefly
afterwards
,
at
the
SIAM
Workshop
last
Friday
.
I
have
extensive
experience
as
a
technical
leader
in
the
design
and
development
of
modeling
and
simulation
software
products
,
mostly
for
the
oil
and
gas
pipeline
industry
.
I
am
looking
for
a
position
that
can
utilize
my
software
development
and
mathematical
skills
.
Getting
out
of
the
narrow
confines
of
the
pipeline
simulation
industry
would
be
a
plus
.
Please
consider
whether
I
might
fit
in
your
group
.
Your
answer
to
a
question
indicated
that
I
have
several
of
the
skills
you
look
for
.
Also
,
please
let
me
know
,
by
email
,
the
names
and
contact
information
of
other
managers
within
Enron
who
might
benefit
from
having
someone
with
my
qualifications
in
their
group
.
Attached
are
my
resume
and
an
addendum
covering
academic
&
consulting
experience
.
Publications
are
available
on
request

I
will
call
you
in
a
couple
of

We
informed
Tana
that
we
made
the
change
in
Global
Counterparty
to
include
,
"
a
division
of

"
.
We

Bill

If
Sam
's
description
below
of
the
GCP
procedure
is
correct
,
it
looks
to
me
like
something
needs
to
be
changed
.
The
difficulty
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
confirmation
system
reads
the
counterparty
's
name
from
Global
Counterparty
.
If
the
correct
legal
name
is
not
in
Global
Counterparty
,
the
confirmation
goes
out
with
the
wrong
legal
name
on
it
seriously
compromising
the
contract
itself
.
My
suggestion
is
that
Global
Counterparty
use
the
same
name
that
the
customer
has
signed
on
the
EnronOnline
Password
Application
--
my
understanding
is
that
the
EnronOnline
team
returns
inappropriate
Applications
to
the
customer
until
they
are
correctly
completed
.
In
this
particular
case
since
the
counterparty
is
still
not
allowed
to
transact
on
EnronOnline
almost
a
month
after
sending
in
their
application
they
are
understandably
upset
and
are
now
complaining
.
I
would
appreciate
it
if
you
could
get
this
one
fixed
today
and
,
if
you
have
any
problem
with
changing
the
GCP
procedure
,
please
let
me
know
.

set
up
correctly
in

Global
Counterparty
System
as
a
Division
of
Cargill

Inc

is
the
full

up
as
such
in

to

Hello
,
Yes
,
GCP
provides
the
links
to
establish
the
correlation
between
the
parent
and
child
for
our
downstream
systems
.
GCP
procedure
is
to
create
Counterparty
names
that
reflect
either
the
Tradename
/
Division
name
or
Parent
Name
--
not
reflect
both
simultaneously
.
(
Although
,
we
have
broken
that
rule
for
Legal
in
the
past
.
)
This
defeats
the
purpose
of
using
a
Tradename
.
Samuel
Tana
,
Please
review
the
process
below
:
When
the
company
is
set
up
in
the
EOL
database
we
link
the
company
to
the
Parent
and
reference
the
CP
ID
.
Sam
,
please
confirm
,
Global
Counterparty
also
provides
the
links
to
establish
correlation
between
the
parent
and
child
for
our
downstream
systems
.
Let
me
know
if
this
is
the
appropriate
steps
that
you
would

To
Whom
It
May
Concern
:
Through
TV
and
newspapers
,
I
hear
constantly
about
identity
fraud
using
stolen
social
security
information
.
I
am
very
concerned
about
this
issue
.
I
have
the
following
suggestion
for
our
company
.
For
example
,
I
am
concerned
when
I
buy
the
monthly
bus
passes
and
I
have
to
fill
in
my
SS
number
.
I
do
not
feel
secure
at
all
to
see
my
SS
in
so
many
databases
at
Enron
,
especially
when
some
databases
are
from
third
-
parties
(
out
-
sourcing
)
.
We
could
use
our
badge
number
there
instead
of
our
SS
.
Please
calendar
and
print
for
my
files
on
this
meeting
.

issues
.
Michelle
Michelle
,
Two
in
one
day
.
We
understand
that
the
pipe
fitters
are
also
planning
to
picket
the
Lake
Worth
,
Florida
project
as
well
.
Our
execution
team
needs
to
get
some
guidance
and
planning
for
this
picketing
should
it
interfere
with
the
progress
of
the
work
.
In
that
respect
,
we
need
to
dial
in
Rick
Johnson
and
Olgletree
to
plan
and
communicate
that
plan
to
the
execution
team
.
I
think
the
first
step
is
a
call
between
yourself
,
me
,
Mark
Stubley
and
Mike
Indivero
.
And
then
another
call
with
all
folks
or
a
meeting
at
the
jobsite
to
lay
out
the
plan
.
Barbara
,
please
organize
a
call
for
Mike
,
Michelle
,
Mark
Stubley
and
me
.
Thanks
.
David
,
Apparently
the
City
informed
them
that
no
permit
is
required
.
We
will
need
local
legal
counsel
to
assist
us
in
this
regard
.
Mike
Indivero
,
I
understand
that
Mr.
Mike
Croall
's
release
date
from
NEPCO
is
Oct
31
,
2001
.
Please
advise
as
to
who
his
replacement
is
and
their
report
date
.

As

I
am
forwarding
to
you
guidelines
prepared
for
global
products
trading
.
It
's
a
good
starting
point
.
I
am
currently
working
on
guidelines
for
Argentina
which
will
address
both
physical
and
financial
trading
.
Other
"
guidelines
"
exist
in
limited
form
for
the
remote
offices
in
Singapore
and
Australia
.
I
am
checking
on
London
.
I
'm
not
exactly
certain
as
to
what
you
are
looking
for
.
Obviously
the
foreign
offices
have
issues
that
may
not
apply
in
the
US
(
although
LA.
is
about
as
close
as
you
can
get
to
a
third
world
country
)
.
One
thing
that
does
n't
show
up
in
the
attachment
is
the
swap
eligibility
issue
.
Let
me
know
how
I
can
help
further
.

printed

and
laminated
it
.
Becky
will
bring
you
the
hard
copy
version
.
Lunch
date
later

see
below
.
It
looks
like
the
2
-
day
L/C
issue
is
an
issue
.
I
'll
call
you
shortly
.
Joseph
Manogue
at
Tiger
called
me
last
night
to
say
he
had
finally
reviewed
the
draft
ISDA
doc
with
all
agreed
changes
put
in
and
lined
from
original
.
He
faxed
it
to
you
and
will
have
the
original
Fedexed
overnight
.
Hope
you
'll
have
time
to
review
it
today
.
S&S
has
again
asked
about
the
gtee
and
l/c
wording
.
They
do
not
have
anything
from
us
in
writing
confirming
the
agreed
changes
.
Joe
asked
that
you
fax
the
revised
gtee
wording
that
has
been
agreed
(
I
believe
it
was
our
agreeing
to
reduce
the
claim
period
from
15
days
down
to
5
)
and
the
new
l/c
wording
(
drops
the
2
day
period
to
replace
an
l/c
with
a
different
bank
if
the
first
refuses
to
pay
)
.
Thanks
!
Call
if
you
have
questions

if
I

help

Confidential
Settlement
Document
Per
CPUC
Rule
51
Gas
Accord
II
Settlement
Participants
:
Attached
is
PG&E
's
Gas
Accord
II
(
GA
II
)
Settlement
Proposal
.
We
believe
it
addresses
many
of
the
issues
and
concerns
you
have
raised
in
the
workshops
.
As
an
overview
,
this
proposal
:
*
Maintains
the
basic
Gas
Accord
structure
in
place
today
for
the
period
2003
to
2007
.
*
*
Offers
end
user
transportation
rates
for
2003
lower
for
most
customers
than
rates
in
effect
today
.
*
*
Provides
for
vintaged
Redwood
path
rates
for
core
customers
.
*
*
Offers
a
7.5
cent
/
dth
rate
to
large
customers
while
minimizing
rate
changes
to
other
customers
,
minimizing
the
incentive
for
these
customers
to
seek
to
bypass
local
transmission
charges
and
other
CPUC
-
approved
charges
.
*
*
Adopts
guidelines
to
improve
reliability
and
help
moderate
prices
in
gas
commodity
markets
,
and
identifies
the
capital
projects
needed
to
meet
these
guidelines
over
the
course
of
the
GA
II
period
(
2003
-
2007
)
.
*
*
Provides
a
high
degree
of
rate
stability
,
with
a
3.5
%
escalator
to
capture
both
inflation
and
the
cost
of
needed
capital
projects
.
The
guaranteed
rates
will
be
adjustable
only
for
significant
changes
in
the
cost
of
capital
or
increased
costs
due
to
governmental
requirements
or
catastrophic
events
.
*
*
Preserves
a
rate
differential
between
the
Redwood
and
Baja
paths
,
although
somewhat
less
than
the
current
differential
.
*
*
Proposes
a
two
-
stage
open
season
for
firm
transportation
services
beginning
in
2003
,
with
end
users
receiving
a
first
option
on
available
capacity
.
*
*
Maintains
the
core
aggregation
program
with
some
adjustments
.
This
also
will
serve
as
a
reminder
that
an
all
-
Party
meeting
is
scheduled
at
PG&E
's
headquarters
in
San
Francisco
on
January
10
and
11
,
to
discuss
this
proposal
and
to
respond
to
your
questions
.
We
look
forward
to
answering
your
questions
and
receiving
your
feedback
.
The
attached
documents
include
the
GA
II
Settlement
proposal
,
an
Attachment
(
a
copy
of
PG&E
's
proposed
Gas
Rule
27
)
,
and
a
set
of
supporting
workpapers
.
Finally
,
please
note
that
the
Settlement
document
and
the
Attachment
are
in
"
Word
2000
"
format
.
We
would
be
glad
to
provide
the
same
documents
in
an
earlier
version
of
Word
,
upon
request
by
individual
Parties
.
We
look
forward
to
seeing
you
on
January
10
-
11

10
or
15
%
,
I
think
we
should
acknowledge
that
a
"
modest
"
increase
may
be
necessary
and
may
in
fact
be
desirable
-
but
that
the
specific
amount
of
increase
should
be
reasoned
and
subject
to
well
thought
out
evidence
and
hearings
,
not
just
determined
by
whim
.
In
general
,
we
should
not
be
overly
prescriptive
at
this
point
and
I
know
you
agree
with
that
.
Otherwise
,
I
think
you
have
captured
the
points
excellently
.
We
're
in
the
process
of
developing
a
strategy
to
take
us
through
the
next
few
months
.
OBSERVATION
--
The
pressure
to
finger
somebody
for
"
price
gouging
"
is
increasing
.
The
administration
is
hell
bent
on
finding
a
"
fall
guy
.
"
The
price
spikes
pose
real
political
risks
for
Davis
and
he
and
his
folks
need
and
want
an
easy
way
out
.
His
press
release
following
the
hearing
renewed
the
call
for
"
refunds
.
"
On
my
panel
,
Loretta
Lynch
asked
Reliant
and
Duke
to
supply
her
with
the
details
of
the
contracts
they
cut
to
sell
their
power
forward
to
marketers
.
And
Carl
Wood
's
remarks
were
extreme
.
At
the
Barton
hearing
,
a
liberal
democrat
(
Filner
)
and
a
conservative
Republican
(
Hunter
)
locked
arms
in
calling
for
refunds
.
Bilbray
joined
the
"
gouging
"
band
wagon
.
The
utilities
repeatedly
called
on
FERC
to
do
a
"
real
"
investigation
,
with
hearings
,
testimony
,
data
discovery
---
the
works
.
On
the
positive
side
,
the
FERC
commissioners
lauded
Wolak
,
his
analysis
,
and
his
remarks
on
the
panel
.
Wolak
said
somewhat
emphatically
that
the
nature
of
California
's
market
structure
makes
it
impossible
to
single
out
a
single
participant
as
the
culprit
.
He
also
stated
that
just
everyone
's
just
acting
in
their
own
self
-
interest
,
responding
to
the
screwed
incentives
embedded
in
the
structure
.
IMPLICATION
--
It
seems
prudent
for
Enron
to
understand
better
its
risks
of
getting
fingered
.
In
which
case
,
the
only
cost
to
Enron
is
the
internal
cost
incurred
to
understand
better
the
risks
of
getting
fingered
.
In
the
medium
case
,
investigations
find
that
Enron
(
like
others
)
"
played
by
the
rules
,
"
but
the
rules
stunk
,
and
Enron
profited
at
the
expense
of
California
consumers
.
You
're
right
,
Sue
.
Rates
ca
n't
go
up
w/out
declaring
the
rate
freeze
over
in
some
fashion
---
trying
to
finesse
it
.
Thanks
very
much
for
the
comments
.
Harry
also
had
a
good
comment
---
do
n't
specify
the
amount
of
rate
increase
in
our
comments
;
rather
note
that
the
rate
increase
needs
to
be
well
-
reasoned
and
based
on
facts
and
evidence
.
Will
make
that
change
.

Tom
Byargeon
,
Kevin
Miller
and
Ken
Loch
in
ENA
are
working
with
producers
in
the
US
involved
in
deep
water
offshore
Louisiana
/
Texas
oil
and
gas
drilling
projects
.
This
financing
activity
was
primarily
started
to
help
ENA
secure
long
term
well
head
and
pipeline
natural
gas
supplies
to
supplement
the
gas
trading
desk
activities
.
Just
like
what
happened
in
Enron
's
initial
VPP
program
they
are
find
more
interest
in
oil
drilling
projects
rather
than
natural
gas
projects
.
The
initial
reservoir
reports
estimate
reserves
of
80
-
120
million
barrels
of
sour
crude
and
they
estimate
initial
production
to
be
40,000
bpd
starting
in
1Q
2003
.
Quality
is
estimated
to
be
a
Mars
type
crude
with
25
-
27
API
Gravity
and
1.5
-
2.0
%
sulfur
.
Plans
are
to
build
a
private
pipeline
to
Equilon
's
West
Delta
#
143
platform
and
then
bring
the
oil
onshore
.
Peggy
is
finding
out
where
WD
#
143
pumps
to
onshore
.
Tom
's
group
would
like
to
know
if
we
have
any
interesting
in
buying
the
crude
on
either
a
fixed
or
floating
basis
.
The
floating
could
be
tied
to
a
Platt
's
index
or
the
NYMEX
.
It
is
far
too
early
to
expect
Murphy
to
enter
into
a
physical
or
financial
contract
,
but
Tom
hopes
to
get
us
first
and
/
or
last
look
from
Murphy
when
the
time
is
right
.
Another
alternative
is
to
give
Murphy
barrels
at
their
95,000
bpd
Meraux
,
Louisiana
refinery
in
exchange
for
the
new
production
barrels
.
Could
someone
in
your
group
please
give
me
a
notional
non
binding
basis
differential
for
this
quality
of
crude
for
Cal
2003
?

Jeff
David
Hoog
01/26/2001
09:37
AM
following
up
on
our
discussion
yesterday
;
for
these
types
of
deals
,
i
do
nt
think
it
s
necessary
to
have
all
the
documentation
of
our
counterparty
's
authorization
to
enter
into
the
agreement
.
these
are
short
term
transactions
and
requiring
this
documentation
will
cause
us
to
lose
business
because
competitive
alternatives
do
not
have
such
burdensome
requirements
.
the
primary
reason
we
need
these
things
is
for
the
scenario
where
a
muni
does
a
derivative
deal
with
an
open
-
ended
downside
,
loses
$
50
million
,
and
then
claims
that
it
was
not
a
valid
contract
.
in
our
case
,
they
are
only
hedging
.
we
are
collecting
a
premium
up
front
and
their
total
cost
is
known
up
front
.
therefore
they
will
not
attempt
to
make
this
claim
.
even
if
they
did
,
our
risk
is
limited
to
the
premium
,
not
some
big
payout
.
the
risk
of
losing
business
is
far
greater
than
the
risk
of
a
counterparty
trying
to
get
their
premium
back
.
seems
like
a
5
second
decision
to
me
.
is
it
possible
to
combine
the
standard
isda
and
our
confirm
into
a
single
long
form
?
by
going
away
from
the
standard
isda
maybe
we
can
eliminate
these
requirements
because
the
payout
liability
is
only
1
-
way
.

What
happened
?
Here
's
a
story
...
as
I
was
waiting
at
the
bus
stop
(
7:35
am
)
to
go
to
school
,
a
lady
approached
me
and
asked
if
I
'd
make
sure
her
daughter
got
on
a
certain
bus
.
The
mother
was
running
late
for
work
and
could
not
wait
.
It
was
now
,
8:15
and
there
was
no
sign
of
her
bus
.
On
top
of
things
,
I
had
quiz
at
8
am
.
Which
I
then
realized
I
missed
.
I
decided
that
Nicki
would
just
have
to
wait
on
her
own
.
I
asked
her
if
she
had
any
relatives
that
would
want
to
know
of
her
whereabouts
.
I
called
her
grandmother
and
explained
things
to
her
.
Pretty
strange
...
aye
.
A
bus
that
runs
through
UofH
arrived
and
I
almost
got
on
without
her
,
but
I
could
n't
do
it
.
Finally
,
I
told
the
little
girl
that
she
would
have
to
accompany
me
to
school
(
8:30
am
)
.
There
were
only
15
minutes
left
of
class
.
I
stayed
for
the
remainder
of
the
lecture
.
After
class
we
went
back
to
bus
stop
and
within
minutes
her
bus
arrived
.
I
told
the
bus
driver
where
to
drop
her
off
.
I
notified
her
grandmother
with
the
time
of
the
departure
.
And
I
was
relieved
when
Nicki
called
to
let
me
know
she
was
home
safe
.
Please
send
the
memo
to
the
EGM
business
heads
as
well
.
Thanks
.

All
,
The
Analyst
and
Associate
Programs
recognize
we
have
many
Analyst
needs
that
need
to
be
addressed
immediately
.
While
we
anticipate
many
new
Analysts
joining
Enron
this
summer
(
late
May
)
and
fulltime
(
August
)
we
felt
it
necessary
to
address
some
of
the
immediate
needs
with
an
Off
-
Cycle
Recruiting
event
.
We
are
planning
this
event
for
Thursday
,
February

first
round
interviews
in
the
morning
and
the
second
round
interviews
in
the
afternoon
.
We
need
for
interviewers
to
commit
either
to
the
morning
(
9
am
-
12
pm
)

more
of
these
Analysts
should
they
be
extended
an
offer
.
Thanks
in
advance
for
your
cooperation
.
Thank
you

Where
does
our

Jen
,
please
take
care
of
this
for
EGM
Marianne
:
The
following
are
my
comments
:
1
.
In
Section
1.1
,
there
should
be
a
parentheses
after
etc.
in
the
5th
line
.
2
.
In
Section
3.1
,
in
the
last
sentence
after
the
proviso
insert
"
a
"
before
the
word
"
change
"
and
after
the
word
"
in
"
.
3
.
In
Section
6.1
,
change
20
Business
Days
to
20
days
.
Also
,
add
a
semicolon
at
the
end
of
clause
(
i
)
.
4
.
In
Section
6.2.1
I
'll
just
note
that
the
discount
rate
sentence
I
think
is
still
an
open
issue
.
5
.
In
Section
6.3
,
clause
(
c
)
should
be
reworded
to
fit
with
the
language
in
the
beginning
of
the
Section
.
6
.
Capitalize
the
word
"
facility
"
in
the
definition
of
Average
Annual
Load
Factor
.
7
.
Delete
the
definition
of
Costs
as
it
is
already
defined
in
Section
6.2.1
.
8
.
Where
is
the
defined
term
Govt
Authority
used
?
9
.
In
the
GTC
,
the
ECP
rep
should
also
apply
to
EESI
.
Also
,
in
the
7th
line
of
the
reps
add
the
word
"
into
"
after
the
word
"
entered
"
and
before
the
word
"
this
"
.
10
.
In
Collateral
Requests
,
insert
a
comma
after
deposit
in
the
last
line
.
I
will
also
add
granting
/
perfection
language
.
11
.
In
Events
of
Default
,
clause
(
a
)
refers
to
a
dispute
section
which
I
'm
not
sure
exists
.
In
clause
(
e
)
,
delete
the
"
s
"
:
from
the
word
consolidation
.
12
.
Remedies
should
be
deleted
as
it
is
already
covered
in
Section
6.1
.
13
.
In
UCC
/
Disclaimer
of
warranties
,
add
a
clause
(
c
)
.
I
would
add
setoff
language
.

Carol
:
I
have
attempted
to
incorporate
the
changes
that
Jim
has
incorporated
in
our
long
form
power
agreement
which
ENA
has
suggested
to
date
into
the
short
form
.
Attached
please
find
a
sample
short
form
(
for
the
Con
Ed
market
)
for
your
review
.
Please
note
the
following
as
you
review
:
1
.
The
short
forms
do
not
contain
the
optionality
relating
to
our
performing
billing
services
--
all
of
our
midmarket
forms
anticipate
that
we
will
act
as
customer
's
billing
agent
and
that
we
will
collect
all
amounts
due
related
to
T&D
and
the
like
from
the
customer
(
and
reflect
same
on
our
invoice
)
and
pass
those
amounts
on
to
the
customer
's
utility
.
2
.
I
did
not
include
a
"
Setoff
"
provision
in
this
draft
,
mainly
because
the
vast
majority
of
the
time
,
we
will
not
,
nor
will
an
affiliate
,
have
another
agreement
in
place
with
these
customers
.
If
you
feel
strongly
about
our
including
a
setoff
provision
,
we
will
do
so
.
3
.
The
change
in
law
provision
reads
a
bit
differently
from
the
long
form
--
the
thinking
here
is
that
the
long
form
language
is
very
lengthy
and
rather
harsh
(
and
we
've
had
great
difficulty
selling
it
in
the
past
)
.
Also
we
do
not
address
calculation
of
a
termination
payment
in
the
event
of
a
change
in
law
as
the
long
form
does
--
again
,
more
in
the
interest
of
"
saving
space
"
than
anything
else
...
If
you
are
comfortable
,
we
will
drive
these
changes
into
our
other
midmarket
power
forms
.
Thanks
again
for
your
help
with
this
project

we
deleted
all
of

I
think
Valerie
Mooney
(
our
credit
person
)
and
Ed
Sacks
are
still
discussing
some
minor
fine
tuning
of
the
LOC
format
.
I
spoke
to
Bob
Bruce
this
morning
-
we
're
all
set
on
the
language
in
the
Schedule
to
the
ISDA
,
and
there
is
a
minor
credit
/
billing
issue
in
Paragraph
13
related
to
the
timing
of
transfer
of
interest
on
collateral
that
Val
will
discuss
with
Ed
as
well
.
As
far
as
the
EEI
goes
,
the
only
remaining
issue
that
I
'm
aware
of
(
aside
from
finalizing
the
LOC
)
is
whether
we
've
finished
coordinating
the
Attachment
containing
the
list
of
prior
transactions
.
Sounds
like
we
may
actually
get
these
documents
executed
early
next
week
.

Our
credit
person
does
n't
understand
why
the
transferability
language
needs
to
be
eliminated
.
It
simply
refers
to
the
same
ICC
publication
for
the
transfer
process
that
governs
the
letter
of
credit
generally
.
Is
there
some
specific
concern
that
we
can
address
?
Russell
:
Your
comments
to
the
transfer
agreement
were
fine
.
With
respect
to
the
Guaranty
,
I
will
delete
the
Schedule
.
Were
there
any
?

All
,
Please
see
the
attached
Interconnect
Agreement
with
Questar
.
I
wanted
you
all
to
have
a
look
at
what
we
believe
is
the
final
draft
.
It
is
a
fairly
standard
,
fully
reimbursable
interconnect
with
Questar
.
Transwestern
will
own
and
operate
the
interconnect
.
You
will
notice
that
Questar
has
requested
a
"
Payment
Plan
"
that
details
when
they
will
pay
Transwestern
for
the
interconnect
due
to
the
recent
Enron
events
.
Also
,
you
will
notice
this
interconnect
may
not
be
subject
to
the
CIAC
tax
gross
up
,
but
to
protect
ourselves
,
we
have
added
language
in
Para
3.2
that
protects
us
financially
if
the
IRS
ever
comes
back
to
determine
that
this
interconnect
is
subject
to
the
CIAC
tax
.
Robert
Guthrie
with
the
tax
department
has
worked
with
us
to
develop
this
language
.
We
hope
to
execute
this
Agreement
this
week
.
If
you
have
any
comments
,
please
let
me
know
.
After
execution
,
we
will
forward
a
final
copy
to
you
for
your
files
.

Earl
,
As
you
look
at
this
,
if
for
some
reason
we
can
not
obtain
ElPaso
ROW
,
we
will
have
to
look
at
Plan
B
which
would
be
to
put
the
metering
on
our
ROW
.
Our
in
-
service
date
is
May
1
.
If
you
think
that
May
1
may
be
difficult
due
to
receiving
the
parts
/
materials
on
a
timely
basis
because
of
the
issues
that
vendors
may
have
with
us
because
of
recent
Enron
events
,
please
let
me
know
.
Questar
has
already
informed
us
that
they
would
help
obtain
parts
/
materials
to
our
specifications
if
it
helps
achieve
an
in
-
service
date
of
May
1
.
Thanks
,
Kim
.
Kim
Has
a
location

Theirs

Attached
is
the
TW
Top
Ten
Shippers
by
Revenues
for
the
year
2001
to
be
reported
in
the
Browncover
report
.
Note
:
Total
transportation
invoiced
for
2001
was
$
180.9
m
.
The
amount
of
transportation
revenues
recorded
in
the
general
ledger
is
$
165.9
m
.
This
difference
is
mainly
due
to
the
following
:
$
10.0
m
-
negotiated
rates
reserve
(
Reliant
,
Sempra
,
Richardson
,
Astr
,
and
BP
Energy
)
-
$
collected
$
2.7
m
-
SoCal
rate
issue
-
$
not
collected
$
1.8
m
-
additional
month
of
PGE
revenues
due
to
prepayment
invoicing
beginning
in
2001
-
$
collected
Revenues
for
these
customers
were
adjusted
according
.
Also
,
revenues
for
the
shippers
acquiring
released
volumes
from
PGE
at
rates
above
TW
's
tariff
rates
were
adjusted
accordingly

Here
is
the
Job
Description
and
the
Operational
Accountabilities
for
the
position
I
mentioned
to
you
last
Sunday
.
As
you
can
see
it
will
take
someone
with
some
very
good
skills
in
organizing
and
interpersonal
relationships
.
It
will
also
require
someone
who
is
fairly
mature
in
their
own
spiritual
journey
.
If
you
know
someone
who
might
fit
the
bill
ask
them
to
contact
me
and
/
or
send
me
their
resume
.
See
you

Kim
The
in
-
service
date
of
May
1
,
will
be
very
difficult
to
attain
.
Since
the
bankruptcy
filing
,
vendors
have
been
very
reluctant
to
ship
material
prior
to
it
being
prepaid
(
Daniels
,
Fisher
,
Rosemont
,
other
)
.
These
are
the
vendors
of
instrumentation
required
for
the
interconnect
.
Questar
may
be
able
to
purchase
material
,
but
some
of
the
items
can
have
up
to
a
60
day
delivery
.
(
From
time
PA
approved
and
funded
to
in
-
service
will
be
75
days
at
most
.
We
have
worked
with
Daniels
on
a
chromatograph
on
another
project
and
prepayment
has
taken
45
days
alone
.
Daniels
is
not
set
up
for
prepayments
as
they
bill
off
an
invoice
and
the
main
office
and
accounting
had
to
create
an
invoice
for
a
chromatograph
that
had
not
been
delivered
.
Not
the
usual
mode
of
operations
.
The
I/C
design
is
for
a
UltraSonic
meter
and
this
is
dependent
on
their
testing
schedule
(
Canada
or
Kansas
are
the
only
two
places
to
test
to
100
%
of
design
)
.
Will
confirm
testing
schedule
and
delivery
dates
with
UltraSonic
ASAP
.
We
will
try
to
complete
the
I/C
with
the
earliest
in
-
service
date
possible
,
but
with
conditions
as
they
are
,
a
realistic
date
would
be
June
15
,
2002
.
If
you
have
questions
or
issues
,
please
let
me
know
.
Thanks

Chanley

Earl
,
As
you
look
at
this
,
if
for
some
reason
we
can
not
obtain
ElPaso
ROW
,
we
will
have
to
look
at
Plan
B
which
would
be
to
put
the
metering
on
our
ROW
.
Our
in
-
service
date
is
May
1
.
If
you
think
that
May
1
may
be
difficult
due
to
receiving
the
parts
/
materials
on
a
timely
basis
because
of
the
issues
that
vendors
may
have
with
us
because
of
recent
Enron
events
,
please
let
me
know
.
Questar
has
already
informed
us
that
they
would
help
obtain
parts
/
materials
to
our
specifications
if
it
helps
achieve
an
in
-
service
date
of
May
1
.
Thanks

A

focuses
on

and
the
actions
of
the

September

The
Orange
County
Register
SACRAMENTO
A
state
Senate
committee
is
set
today
to
start
serving
16
subpoenas
on
electricity
producers
and
officials
who
manage
California
's
energy
grid
to
determine
whether
they
acted
in
concert
to
manipulate
energy
prices
.
The
investigative
committee
,
headed
by
state
Sen.
Joe
Dunn
,
D
-
Santa
Ana
,
is
focusing
on
a
series
of
events
last
fall
filled
with
enough
Shakespearean
plot
twists
and
intrigue
that
it
has
earned
a
name
around
the
Capitol
:
"
the
palace
coup
.
"
Lawmakers
and
consumer
groups
allege
that
the
events
-
directed
by
the
man
who
heads
the
state
's
energy
grid
-
fueled
the
California
energy
crisis
,
pushed
the
state
into
the
power
-
buying
business
and
helped
make
billions
of
dollars
for
power
producers
.
The
central
question
behind
the
palace
coup
is
whether
Terry
Winter
,
the
president
of
the
Independent
System
Operator
,
acted
alone
when
he
took
steps
to
remove
key
price
caps
designed
to
limit
the
amount
power
generators
could
charge
.
Winter
defied
his
own
board
and
Gov.
Gray
Davis
when
he
filed
a
50
-
page
request
to
remove
the
caps
,
records
and
interviews
show
.
I
do
n't
know
how
these
events
could
have
taken
place
without
some
concerted
effort
,
said
Dunn
.
Davis
spokesman
Steve
Maviglio
said
the
governor
felt
"
betrayed
"
by
the
actions
of
Winter
.
The
governor
believes
it
was
the
defining
moment
,
when
what
was
a
mounting
problem
turned
into
an
instant
crisis
,
Maviglio
said
.
Winter
refused
comment
,
referring
all
questions
to
the
public
relations
office
.
ISO
spokesman
Gregg
Fishman
said
Dunn
's
committee
will
find
no
criminal
conduct
.
The
decision
was
made
by
ISO
upper
management
with
one
goal
in
mind
:
to
keep
the
lights
on
.
At
the
time
,
generators
were
refusing
to
sell
power
in
California
because
of
the
price
caps
.
It
was
an
emergency
,
Fishman
said
.
We
had
to
take
action
.

They
(
electricity

grinned
and
beared
the

price
cap
,
but
this
new
plan
by
ISO
was
too
much
,
said
Dunn
,
whose

has
been
investigating
since
March

filed
letters

the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
,
demanding
that
the
new

be

.
If
not
removed
immediately
,
the

Although
there
is
nothing
illegal
about
the
generators
acting
together
to
lobby
against
price
caps
,
Dunn
believes
the
letters
and
other
actions
around
the
same
time
showed
clear
coordination
among
energy
officials
.
He
said
the
main
aim
of
the
subpoenas
will
be
to
determine
whether
collusion
occurred
to
"
fix
"
prices
,
which
would
violate
federal
trade
laws
.
In
the
Oct.
31
letters
,
electricity
producers
told
federal
officials
that
if
price
caps
were
n't
removed
it
would
lead
to
a
collapse
of
the
energy
market
.
The
generators
got
their
way
.
The
next
day
,
the
federal
commission
killed
the
new
pricing
plan
.
What
was
left
in
place
was
a
$
250
price
cap
established
five
months
earlier
.
Power
producers
then
turned
their
attention
toward
killing
that
cap
,
saying
they
could
n't
make
a
profit
even
under
these
constraints
.
They
began
to
withhold
power
from
California
,
and
on
Dec.
7
the
ISO
declared
its
first
Stage
3
emergency
and
braced
for
blackouts
,
which
were
narrowly
averted
.
What
followed
the
next
day
is
considered
by
the
governor
and
Dunn
to
be
the
pivotal
moment
of
the
energy
crisis
.
Winter
,
who
in
his
position
as
president
and
chief
operating
officer
of
the
ISO
,
submitted
a
50
-
page
emergency
request
,
asking
federal
officials
to
abolish
the
$
250
price
cap
.
Final
authority
over
lifting
the
cap
rested
with
the
federal
government
.
Neither
the
ISO
board
,
which
had
established
the
price
cap
,
nor
the
governor
learned
of
Winter
's
actions
until
the
cap
had
been
removed
.
He
did
n't
mention
anything
about
it
.

It
's
a

of

Have
they
expressed
any
interest
in
negotiating
?
There
is
nothing
wrong
with
a
REAL
negotiation
,
but
nothing
particularly
helpful
about
generating
one
that
s
just
for

.
Particularly
in
the
absence
of
any

from
them

Where
is
the
"

"
explanation
of
the
transportation
piece
?
As
I
have
told
RNR
,
I
think
we
should
advise
Duke
in
writing
that
its
IP
is
not
in
conformity
with
the
contract
,
since
it
is
in
the
alternative
,
and
that
our
IP
is
hence
the
only
one
that
will
be
before
the
arbitrators
(
since
Duke
clearly
can
not
change
it's
ineffective
IP
at
this
stage
,
having
already
seen
ours
)
.
Accordingly
,
the
only
issue
left
for
arbitration
is
whether
our
IP
(
the
only
one
and
therefore
the
one
they
have
to
choose
)
is
or
is
not
an
economic
hardship
under
the
contract
.

Is
it
right
that
Enron
has
3
sets
of
bad
faith
proceedings
in
Texas
?
(
c

Are
you
happy
with
the
draft
letter
to
Beachcrofts
I
sent
you
?
Please
give
me
a
call
if
you
would
like
to
discuss
.
Justin
Not
when
I
was
there
,
but
I
was
n't
there
the
whole
time
.
Michelle
and
Ken
,
were
you
able
to
discuss
the
"
bad
faith
"
proceedings
issue
yesterday
?
If
you
got
the
chance
today
,
I
should
be
really
grateful
if
one
of
you
could
give
me
a
call
to
discuss
this
issue
;
I
think
we
should
set
out
DPC
's
position
clearly
on
this
in
correspondence
without
too
much
delay
.

Dear
Mr.
Sanders
-
?
While
I
left
a
you
a
phone
message
with
some
information
about
our
project
,
I
thought
I
could
give
you
some
additional
details
by
e-mail
as
well
...
?
We
are
still
very
interested
in
having
Enron
support
our
eCommerce
Dispute
Management
Protocol
.?
We
have
had
enthusiastic
responses
from
companies
such
as
AT&T
,
Duke
Energy
,
Pitney
Bowes
and
Daimler
Chrysler
,
and
I
would
be
pleased
to
answer
any
questions
you
may
have
about
this
focal
point
for
our
educational
efforts
.?
The
real
purpose
of
my
call
,
however
,
is
related
to
the
services
we
will
provide
to
support
the
aspirational
statements
of
the
Protocol
.
I
am
a
member
of
the
design
group
that
has
been
developing
the
American
Arbitration
Association
's
dispute
management
systems
and
services
for
eCommerce
B2B
transactions
.?
At
this
time
we
are
putting
together
small
working
groups
to
validate
some
of
our
assumptions
and
refine
our
initial
service
offerings
.
Initially
our
design
group
,
along
with
perhaps
one
of
our
technology
consultants
,
would
like
to
meet
with
a
group
of
Enron
people
for
half
a
day
.?
Ideally
this
group
would
consist
of
four
to
six
people
from
finance
,
legal
,
and
operations
so
that
we
get
good
cross-functional
feedback
about
our
services
.?
Before
the
meeting
we
would
provide
you
with
a
brief
description
of
our
proposed
service
offerings
and
a
list
of
points
for
discussion
at
the
meeting
.
We
are
very
concerned
with
providing
services
that
are
relevant
to
that
environment
.
We
would
like
to
meet
between
November
14
and
?
December
1
?
since
construction
of
our
services
is
already
underway
.?
Please
let
me
know
what
is
possible
,
and
feel
free
to
give
me
a
call
if
you
have
any
questions
(
978-376-9004
)
.
?
Thanks

OK
,
perhaps
it
was
inevitable
.
But
it
is
now
official
.
A
press
conference
will
be
held
to
discuss
the
consumer
class
action
lawsuit
to
be
filed
today
.
WHEN
:
11
am
-
noon
WHAT
:
Copies
of
the
filed
complaint
will
be
made
available
at
that
time
.
UCAN
's
executive
director
and
the
attorney
team
will
be
available
to
answer
questions
about
the
complaint
.
We
are
hopeful
that
we
can
post
the
complaint
to
the
UCAN
web
site
later
today
.
***********************************
the
industry
of
Marriage
and
Kids
,
you
heard
me
.
Marriage
is
,
in
and
of
itself
,
a
noble
concept
,
but
it
too
often
leads
to
kids
and
kids
flat
out
suck
.
How
can
I
say
such
an
abomination
,
ask
you
?
Look
around
you
and
notice
all
the
mind
numbing
trailor
trash
cretins
out
there
who
should
not
be
procreating
,
yet
they
do
.
These
are
the
people
who
keep
Jerry
springer
on
the
air
.
These
are
the
kids
who
will
destroy
society
,
because
of
the
crapfest
the
American
family
has
become
under
the
post
hippie
culture
,
you
heard
again
.
And
you
might
think
by
reading
this
I
blame
the
kids
.....
Not
so
,
Kids
are
what
kids
are
and
will
do
what
they
do
.
It
is
literally
monkey
see
and
monkey
do
with
them
.
That
will
likely
never
change
.
Very
few
parents
do
this
.
And
this
is
a
direct
result
of
the
Politically
correct
,
permissive
,
time
out
granting
bullshit
liberal
culture
that
has
caused
this
.
When
you
blame
it
all
on
society
,
there
's
noone
to
to
take
responsibility
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
have
generation
of
fucked
up
kids
who
are
likley
smoking
,
drinking
,
doing
drugs
,
fucking
the
neighbor
or
some
internet
perv
just
because
you
are
too
lazy
to
see
waht
they
're
doing
.
People
like
this
will
never
have
my
sympathy
,
nor
do
they
deserve
my
sympathy
.
Look
inside
yourselves
parents
,
is
this
you
?
Probably
it
is
.
Fuck
you
.
Stop
trying
to
pawn
your
brats
off
on
others
to
"
get
a
break
"
.
You
made
a
choice
to
be
a
mommy
,
you
do
nt
get
a
break
until
they
move
out
,
that
s
the
choice
that
you
madea
and
that
's
life
.
Tough
shit
.
Just
because
you
're
stuck
,
does
nt
give
you
the
right
to
drag
down
all
the
singles
around
you
.
Another
time
I
'll
segueway
into
all
the
fun
work
related
instances
where
"
Mommies
"
get
out
of
doing
work
and
hiding
behind
childcare
as
the
reason
.
This
is
the
insidious
conspiracy
I
call
"
Mommism
"
.
It
must
be
stamped
out
.

]
(
Newsday.com
)
It
looks
like
NASA
is
ready
to
sour
again
after
it's
devastating
loss
from
the
Columbia
accident
which
occurred
nearly
two
years
ago
.
Now
,
NASA
engineers
and
astronauts
are
almost
giddy
with
"
go
"
fever
as
the
tentative
date
for
the
first
launch
since
the
Columbia
disaster
approaches
.
The
most
important
question
is
n't
whether
Discovery
is
technically
ready
to
fly
with
new
safety
features
and
emergency
procedures
,
but
whether
the
agency
itself
has
learned
from
the
crucial
errors
most
common
to
Challenger
and
Columbia
,
errors
that
grew
out
of
a
management
culture
that
discouraged
criticism
and
sacrificed
safety
for
image
-
puffing
and
budget
-
cutting
.
I
hope
so
.
Seeing
another
"
Columbia
"
incident
can
be
quite
frightening
(
I
woke
up
to
it
early
in
the
morning
when
I
was
in
Texas
)
.
We
do
n't
need
another
incident
as
exploring
the
cosmos
is
something
that
keeps
our
imagination
going
as
a
species
.
You
do
have
to
give
NASA
credit
on
some
things
as
they
have
eliminated
the
"
fear
of
reporting
failure
"
culture
that
probably
led
to
the
lack
of
reporting
defects
on
the
Columbia
shuttle
.
Instead
they
are
encouraging
everyone
to
come
forward
if
they
see
any
potential
problems
(
as
it
is
clear
that
overlooked
problems
could
result
in
unnecessary
losses
)
.
But
supporters
are
pointing
a
few
good
things
out
:
Clearly
,
the
agency
has
worked
hard
at
tackling
the
technical
challenges
posed
by
a
superb
and
surprisingly
independent
-
minded
investigative
panel
.
One
is
a
special
tool
to
detect
damage
to
the
thermal
-
protective
tile
while
in
orbit
-
something
the
Columbia
crew
would
have
welcomed
.
The
other
is
a
new
fuel
tank
"
guaranteed
"
by
NASA
not
to
shed
potentially
fatal
hunks
of
insulation
.
NASA
has
some
PR
hurdles
to
overcome
in
the
future
.
But
let
s
hope
for
their
sake
(
and
the
sake
of
all
space
lovers
out
there
)
that
they
can
redefine
their
image
and
rekindle
the
hope
of
space
colonization
again
.

Healing
the
Collective
Body
In
George
Orwell
's
influential
novel
"
1984
"
doublethink
is
a
device
promoted
by
the
totalitarian
state
government
to
make
people
accept
two
irreconcilable
ideas
at
the
same
time
such
as
"
war
is
peace
"
.
I
see
the
merit
in
flowing
with
duality
.
I
have
written
a
lot
recently
about
healing
the
self
so
today
here
are
a
few
words
on
healing
our
collective
body
,
mind
and
soul
.
Think
of
all
life
,
if
you
will
,
as
one
great
choir
or
one
grand
congregation
.
Our
strength
is
in
our
unity
and
harmony
.
Any
major
dischord
and
we
all
suffer
.
Any
insult
to
the
collective
good
brings
us
all
down
.
Living
out
of
synch
with
nature
is
the
great
disease
,
from
that
flows
all
the
tributaries
we
have
come
to
think
of
as
sickness
.
We
are
only
as
strong
as
our
weakest
,
we
are
only
as
healthy
as
the
sickest
amongst
us
-
playing
sports
and
being
in
the
army
taught
me
that
lesson
before
I
was
finished
being
a
teenager
.
When
the
healthy
treat
the
sick
with
scorn
and
intolerance
it
brings
us
all
down
.
When
those
lucky
enough
not
to
have
Herpes
create
a
climate
of
shame
and
indignity
for
those
of
us
who
do
,
not
only
are
they
hurting
us
,
but
they
are
hurting
themselves
.
There
is
no
escape
from
the
collective
ocean
we
all
swim
in
.
What
you
project
will
always
come
back
to
either
reward
or
haunt
you
.
We
are
now
suffering
from
the
consequences
of
our
rape
of
the
environment
,
our
rejection
of
the
natural
for
the
industrial
,
and
our
embrace
of
violence
over
peace
.
Jesus
said
that
what
you
do
the
least
of
the
people
you
do
to
him
.
What
are
you
doing
to
the
least
of
the
people
?
If
we
are
all
in
this
thing
together
,
let
's
play
nice
.
Remember
that
what
you
do
to
yourself
affects
me
and
everybody
else
,
remember
that
what
you
do
to
me
and
anyone
else
shapes
your
destiny
.
No
matter
what
progress
we
make
as
individuals
in
becoming
healthier
,
we
will
never
achieve
real
health
until
we
collectively
decide
to
create
a
healthier
reality
.
Fortunately
circumstances
will
force
our
hand
soon
since
our
collective
bad
behaviour
can
not
continue
indefinitely
.
In
the
near
future
collective
choices
will
need
to
be
made
.
Will
we
choose
to
live
in
harmony
with
this
planet
or
crash
and
burn
in
a
conflagration
of
arrogance
and
disregard
?
Will
we
choose
to
rise
about
prejudice
and
intolerance
or
go
down
kicking
and
screaming
with
holding
on
to
fear
and
anger
?

Revolutionary
Compensation
Agel
has
created
a
new
compensation
structure
that
is
truly
revolutionary
.
It
is
our
belief
that
this
compensation
plan
will
produce
some
of
the
largest
checks
in
network
marketing
history
.
The
plan
ca
n't
be
described
as
a
binary
,
a
breakaway
,
a
unilevel
,
or
a
forced
matrix
.
It
is
a
revolutionary
hybrid
.
What
is
long
term
viability
?
It
is
not
just
company
longevity
.
If
you
used
to
make
$
100
k
and
now
only
make
$
30
k
,
this
is
not
long
term
viability
.
Ten
years
later
your
check
should
still
be
the
same
or
greater
,
fulfilling
the
promise
of
long
-
term
residual
income
.
The
Agel
compensation
plan
includes
the
principles
that
ensure
that
promise
can
be
fulfilled
for
those
who
work
at
it
.

Hi

Dharma
--
Kaoshikii
is
a
dance
which
was
invented
in
1978
by
Shrii
Shrii
A'nandamu'rti
.
It
is
a
psycho-spiritual
exercise
and

the
mind
by

stamina
and
strength
.
It
can
ward
off
and
cure
a
number
of
diseases
,
keeps
the
body
youthful
and
enables
an
easy
delivery
in
childbirth
.
Kaoshikii
comes
from
the
Sanskrit
word
'
kosa
'
meaning
shell
or
layer
of
mind
.
Thus
kaoshikii
is
a
blossoming
of
the
microcosm
(
unit
being
)
in
its
attempt
to
attain
a
link
with
the
Macrocosm
(
Cosmic
Consciousness
)
.
This
attempt
is
normally
referred
to
as
mysticism
.

Then
to

the
step
with
the
beat
of
"
dhin

Here
is
the
ideation

Bending
backward
represents
:
"
I

face
all
obstacles
that
may
come

steps
represent

Quebecker
wins
U.S.
bravery
award
Pittsburgh
-
A
Quebec
man
was
awarded
a
Carnegie
Medal
for
bravery
on
Monday
for
saving
two
friends
by
fighting
off
a
polar
bear
with
a
pocket
knife
two
years
ago
on
Baffin
Island
Dr.
Eric
Fortier
,
34
,
of
Gatineau
,
Que.
,
used
a
pocket
knife
to
attack
a
polar
bear
on
Baffin
Island
,
just
south
of
the
Arctic
Circle
,
to
save
two
friends
who
were
being
mauled
.
All
of
the
research
and
all
of
the
preparation
I
did
leading
up
to
the
trip
gave
no
indication
that
there
were
bears
in
the
Soper
[
River
]
valley
where
we
were
canoeing
,
Dr.
Fortier
said
.
Dr.
Fortier
,
an
orthodontist
,
learned
there
was
at
least
one
polar
bear
in
the
central
region
of
Baffin
Island
in
July
2001
when
he
felt
what
he
thought
was
a
dog
leaning
on
his
tent
wall
.
My
first
thought
was
to
push
it
away
,
he
said
.
A
few
seconds
later
my
girlfriend
saw
the
shadow
of
a
bear
's
paw
through
the
tent
fly
and
then
it
started
ripping
through
the
ceiling
.
The
polar
bear
is
more
dangerous
than
most
other
bears
.
The
two
screamed
to
frighten
the
bear
and
warn
their
friends
in
a
tent
several
metres
away
but
the
bear
ripped
into
that
tent
and
began
mauling
31
-
year
-
old
Alain
Parenteau
.
Their
screams
changed
,
Dr.
Fortier
said
.
I
grabbed
my
glasses
and
my
knife
and
unzipped
my
tent
and
headed
out
.
The
bear
dwarfed
the
6
-
foot
-
1
Mr.
Parenteau
,
knocking
him
to
the
ground
,
he
said
.
Dr.
Fortier
threw
a
large
rock
at
the
bear
,
distracting
it
and
allowing
Parenteau
to
escape
but
it
then
turned
on
25
-
year
-
old
Patricia
Doyon
,
who
was
in
the
same
tent
.
Again
Dr.
Fortier
threw
rocks
at
the
bear
and
again
its
target
was
able
to
escape
.
The
bear
gave
chase
and
I
gave
chase
,
he
said
.
At
some
point
,
Patricia
tripped
or
the
bear
tripped
her
and
was
at
her
back
.
At
some
point
,
Patricia
trip
@@ed
or
the
bear
trip
@@ed
her
and
was
at
her
back
.
I
was
beside
the
bear
's
head
and
I
stabbed
it
with
an
upper
cut
below
the
jaw
in
the
neck
a
couple
of
times
.
"
The
bear
ran
off
.
While
there
was
some
fur
and
blood
on
the
nine
-
centimetre
blade
,
Dr.
Fortier
said
he
does
n't
think
he
hurt
the
bear
badly
.
Both
Mr.
Parenteau
and
Ms.
Doyon
,
however
,
were
bleeding
badly
.
Dr.
Fortier
and
his
girlfriend
lashed
two
canoes
together
and
paddled
eight
kilometres
along
the
Soper
River
.
Dr.
Fortier
travelled
another
three
kilometres
by
foot
to
seek
help
in
the
nearest
settlement
.
Both
Mr.
Parenteau
and
Ms.
Doyon
were
airlifted
to
a
hospital
and
survived
,
though
Mr.
Parenteau
had
a
gash
within
a
centimetre
of
his
jugular
,
Dr.
Fortier
said
.
Dr.
Fortier
was
one
of
15
people
to
receive
the
Carnegie
Medal
on
Monday
.
The
other
Canadian
recipient
of
the
medal
was
Ronald
Joseph
Crawford
,
42
,
of
Hamilton
,
who
was
killed
Aug.
4
,
2002
,
while
trying
to
defend
a
Hamilton
sandwich
shop
owner
from
a
robber
wielding
a
knife
.
Mr.
Crawford
threw
several
punches
at
the
assailant
before
he
was
stabbed
in
the
heart
.
U.S.
industrialist
Andrew
Carnegie
started

he
tried

Hi
all
,
I
say
why
not
?
The
main
reason
is
Google
is
more
accessible
to
the
global
community
and
you
can
rest
assured
that
it
's
not
going
to
go
away
.
I
have
seen
great
fan
sites
suddenly
disappear
without
notice
and
for
no
reason
.
Usually
this
happens
because
the
developer
of
the
site
can
no
longer
afford
the
cost
of
bandwidth
being
used
.
That
said
,
the
maintenance
of
this
forum
is
handled
by
Google
and
thus
will
remain
reliable
and
it
will
ultimately
give
us
more
time
to
play
:)
.
I
'm
nothing
more
than
a
devoted
fan
of
the
game
myself
and
I
hope
that
this
area
can
become
a
haven
for
deep
fan
discussions
.

BUT
they
stated
that
they
will
take
as
long
as
it
takes
to
work
out
all
the
bugs
so
who
really
know
how
long
.
as
far
as
pre
order
go
to

they
have
a

major
retailers
that
carry
it
there
are
also
a
few
websites
that
you
could
order
it

of
games
played
.
The
alliance
is
a
pretty
straightforward
one
.
It
was
formed
to
allow
many
different
guilds
who
were
all
strictly
honorable
to
come
together
as
a
family
and
allow
them
many
people
to
game
with
.
There
are
no
other
requirements
other
than
we
ask
that
members
greet
each
new
member
and
each
new
alliance
and
also
feel
free
to
post
in
any
of
the
forums
.
We
are
also
a
group
who
is
looking
for
members
for
our
own
select
guild
called
ULGG
of
GW
...
which
is
a
part
of
the
alliance
with
the
same
name
.
We
play
in
all
aspects
of
the
game
and
we
hand
pick
our
members
.
I
would
like
to
personally
invite
each
of
you
to
visit
our
website
.
You
are
individuals
of
quality
,
and
in
our
alliance
we
seek
quality
of
member
over
quantity
of
member
.
You
will
be
asked
to
register
,
and
then
you
should
wander
over
to
the
Announce
Your
Arrival
Section
and
present
yourself
.
You
will
be
greeted
by
many
members
of
this
wonderful
family
.
I
do
hope
to
see
you
visiting
us
at
the
fire
and
we
shall
prepare
a
feast
for
you
,
as
well

If
you
paste
this

it

I
extend

you
in

Come

you

the

,
the

,
drug
and
alcohol
addicts
,
the

and
unemployable
.
We
are
the

in

has
become
a

against

.
And
who
are
you

You
who
like

of

You
who
watch
as

and

while
you

a
police
force
?
Bullet

automatic

,
helicopters
,
tanks
,
robots
...
the
testosterone
is
oozing
through
the
streets
,
more
prisons
,
longer
sentences
,
tighten
the
belt
,
spartan
conditions
,
task
forces
,
gang
units
,
gun

.
And
what
is
there
to
show
for
it
?
Unemployent
stays
low
because
half
the
population
oversees
those
"
out
of
the
workforce
"
,
the
dregs
,
the
rabble
,
the
enemy
?
Please
tell
me
there
is
a
deeper
reason
.
More
humane
?
More
like
a
cohesive
society
with
a
shared
sense
of
purpose
,
who
can
identify
Us
and
Them
?
Do
you
live
in
a
gated
community
or
gentrified
neighborhood
?
By
the
way
,
have
you
read
the
Declaration
of
Independence
and
US
Constitution
-
or
do
you
only
know
the
first
phrases
?
It
's
about
time
we
got
together
.
Please
know
that
I
have
yet
to
meet
a
convict
who
wants
their
child
to
be
a
thief
,
an
addict
,
a
dealer
,
a
prostitute
,
or
a
violent
individual
.
Most
of
us
still
have
hope
for
ourselves
even
when
stuck
in
the
darkest
dilemmas
,
ruts
and
catch
-
22s
.
Most
of
us
believe
in
crafting
laws
and
instilling
order
.
Many
of
us
have
burrowed
beneath
the
surface
to
find
a
spiritual
sense
of
being
,
an
understanding
force
at
least
as
powerful
as
those
we
succumbed
to
,
and
many
of
use
would
n't
escape
if
you
opened
the
front
door
.
Did
you
know
that
approximately
10
million
Americans
are
either
incarcerated
,
on
probation
,
on
parole
or
once
were
in
those
categories
?
Each
of
those
10
million
have
families
,
friends
,
neighbors
...
and
so
closer
and
closer
does
the
We
interface
with
the
You
.
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
time
we
talked
?
Are
you
ready
?
Can
you
accept
that
the
road
we
are
travelling
points
toward
a
grim
and
painful
future
?
Do
you
have
the
heart
to
face
monumental
failures
while
bravely
struggling
beyond
where
we
are
now
?
I
know
that
some
of
you
are
,
and
that
some
of
us
are
,
and
this
is
what
gives
me
hope
.
You
need
our
insights
just
as
we
need
your
structure
.
It
is
never
over
,
especially
when
a
real
solution
,
a
real
treatment
for
our
sickness
,
is
yet
to
begin
.

Dear
Sir
/
Madam
,
This
letter
might
surprise
you
because
we
have
not
met
neither
in
person
nor
by
correspondence
.
I
came
to
know
of
you
in
my
search
for
a
reliable
and
reputable
person
to
handle
a
very
confidential
business
transaction
,
which
involves
the
transfer
of
a
huge
sum
of
money
to
an
account
requiring
maximum
confidence
.
I
am
writing
you
in
absolute
confidence
primarily
to
seek
your
assistance
in
acquiring
oil
funds
that
are
presently
trapped
in
the
republic
of
Iraq
.
This
unsuccessful
venture
was
soon
followed
by
a
falling
-
out
with
his
Iraqi
partner
,
who
sought
to
acquire
additional
oil
revenue
sources
in
the
neighboring
emirate
of
Kuwait
,
a
wholly
-
owned
U.S.
-
British
subsidiary
.
My
father
re-secured
the
petroleum
assets
of
Kuwait
in
1991
at
a
cost
of
sixty
-
one
billion
U.S.
dollars
(
$
61,000,000,000
)
.
Out
of
that
cost
,
thirty
-
six
billion
dollars
(
$
36,000,000,000
)
were
supplied
by
King
Hussein
,
Kingdom
of
Saudi
Arabia
and
other
Persian
Gulf
monarchies
,
and
sixteen
billion
dollars
(
$
16,000,000,000
)
supplied
by
German
and
Japanese
partners
.
But
my
father
's
former
Iraqi
business
partner
remained
in
control
of
the
republic
of
Iraq
and
its
petroleum
reserves
.
My
family
is
calling
for
your
urgent
assistance
in
funding
the
removal
of
the
President
of
the
Republic
of
Iraq
and
acquiring
the
petroleum
assets
of
his
country
,
as
compensation
for
the
costs
of
removing
him
from
power
.
Unfortunately
,
our
partners
from
1991
are
not
willing
to
shoulder
the
burden
of
this
new
venture
,
which
in
its
upcoming
phase
may
cost
the
sum
of
100
billion
to
200
billion
dollars
(
$
100,000,000,000
-
$
200,000,000,000
)
,
both
in
the
initial
acquisition
and
in
long
-
term
management
.
Without
the
funds
from
our
1991
partners
,
we
would
not
be
able
to
acquire
the
oil
revenue
trapped
within
Iraq
.
That
is
why
my
family
and
our
colleagues
are
urgently
seeking
your
gracious
assistance
.
I
would
beseech
you
to
transfer
a
sum
equaling
ten
to
twenty
-
five
percent
(
10
-
25
%
)
of
your
yearly
income
to
our
account
to
aid
in
this
important
venture
.
I
propose
that
you
make
this
transfer
before
the
fifteenth
(
15th
)
of
the
month
of
April
.
I
know
that
a
transaction
of
this
magnitude
would
make
anyone
apprehensive
and
worried
.
But
I
am
assuring
you
that
all
will
be
well
at
the
end
of
the
day
.
A
bold
step
taken
shall
not
be
regretted
,
I
assure
you
.
Please
do
be
informed
that
this
business
transaction
is
100
%
legal
.
If
you
do
not
wish
to
co-operate
in
this
transaction
,
please
contact
our
intermediary
representatives
to
further
discuss
the
matter
.
I
pray
that
you
understand
our
plight
.
My
family
and
our
colleagues
will
be
forever
grateful
.
Please
reply
in
strict
confidence
to

Excellent
answer
googlenut
.
Let
me
add
some
additional
info
.
You
can
get
details
about
NASA
spending
here
,
from
their
own
webpage
.
Also
,
from
their
own
webpage
,
reasons
why
NASA
is
important
,
in
a
5th
grade
format
.
I
guess
if
you
are
someone
not
familiar
with
how
NASA
benefits
our
society
I
can
see
how
one
might
form
the
opinion
of
yheggy
-
ga
.
Let
me
put
it
this
way
-
If
you
have
watched
TV
recently
,
crossed
a
modern
bridge
,
flown
in
an
airplane
,
recieved
any
form
of
modern
medicine
,
did
any
mathematics
,
drove
a
car
,
used
a
cellular
phone
,
etc.
then
you
have
somehow
directly
reaped
the
rewards
which
NASA
has
returned
to
us
.
Also
NASA
has
a
large
outreach
program
for
education
,
some
people
believe
this
is
important
.

of
course
,
in
a
perfect
world
,
tax
payers
'
money
would
go
toward
some
sort
of
national
healthcare
program
,
and
housing
for
the
homeless
,
but
this
is
far
from
a
perfect
world
.
in
response
to
Steve

comment
:
do
you
really
believe
that
spending
trillions
on
space
exploration
over
the
years
was
the
ONLY
way
to
invent
the
cellfone
?
and
bridges
???
i
find
that
extremely
hard
to
believe
.
i
think
it
could
have
been
done
in
a
much
more
cost
efficient
way
,
right
here
on
bad

I
realize

it

sound
strange
,
but
we
are
desparate
in
our
efforts

are
willing
to
try
anything
to
help
our
dear
sick
friend
.
This
costs
absolutely
nothing
,
and
will
take
about
one
minute
of
your

have
run
out

That
band
is
involved
in
a
local
competition
which
promises
a
$
5000
first
prize
,
which
they
would
like
to
win
in
order
to
donate
it
to
the
benefit
fund
which
they
have
started
.
Below
are
some
emails
to
friends
explaining
a
little
more
about
this
effort
.
What
we
are
trying
to
do
is
solicit
votes

the
band
,
in
order
to
put
them
in
first
place
.
They
are
currently
in
third
place
,
and
need
your
help
so
that
the
prize
money
can
be
used
for
a
humanatarian
cause

China
's
insatiable
demand
for
energy
is
prompting
fears
of
financial
and
diplomatic
collisions
around
the
globe
as
it
seeks
reliable
supplies
of
oil
from
as
far
away
as
Brazil
and
Sudan
.
An
intrusion
into
Japanese
territorial
waters
by
a
Chinese
nuclear
submarine
last
week
and
a
trade
deal
with
Brazil
are
the
latest
apparently
unconnected
consequences
of
China
's
soaring
economic
growth
.
Increased
car
usage
in
China
is
creating
a
high
demand
for
petrol
The
connection
,
however
,
lies
in
an
order
issued
last
year
by
President
Hu
Jintao
to
seek
secure
oil
supplies
abroad
-
preferably
ones
which
could
not
be
stopped
by
America
in
case
of
conflict
over
Taiwan
.
The
submarine
incident
was
put
down
to
a
"
technical
error
"
by
the
Chinese
government
,
which
apologised
to
Japan
.
But
even
before
the
incident
the
People
's
Daily
,
the
government
mouthpiece
,
had
commented
that
competition
over
the
East
China
Sea
between
the
two
countries
was
"
only
a
prelude
of
the
game
between
China
and
Japan
in
the
arena
of
international
energy
"
.
The
Brazil
trade
deal
included
funding
for
a
joint
oil
-
drilling
and
pipeline
programme
at
a
cost
that
experts
said
would
add
up
to
three
times
the
cost
of
simply
buying
oil
on
the
market
.
The
West
,
however
,
has
paid
little
attention
to
these
developments
.
In
September
,
China
threatened
to
veto
any
move
to
impose
sanctions
on
Sudan
over
the
atrocities
in
Darfur
.
It
has
invested
$
3
billion
in
the
African
country
's
oil
industry
,
which
supplies
it
with
seven
per
cent
of
its
needs
.
A
week
before
,
China
's
second
biggest
state
oil
firm
had
signed
a
$
70
billion
deal
for
oilfield
and
natural
gas
development
with
Iran
,
which
already
supplies
13
per
cent
of
China
's
needs
.
China
has
its
own
reserves
of
oil
and
natural
gas
and
once
was
a
net
oil
exporter
.
But
as
its
economy
has
expanded
by
an
average
of
nine
per
cent
per
year
for
the
last
two
decades
,
so
has
its
demand
for
energy
.
This
year
it
overtook
Japan
as
the
world
's
second
largest
consumer
of
energy
,
behind
the
US
.
Its
projected
demand
,
boosted
by
a
huge
rise
in
car
ownership
as
well
as
the
need
to
find
alternatives
to
polluting
coal
for
electricity
generation
,
has
contributed
to
the
surge
in
the
price
of
oil
this
year
.
Since
President
Hu
ordered
state
-
owned
oil
firms
to
"
go
abroad
"
to
ensure
supply
,
they
have
begun
drilling
for
gas
in
the
East
China
Sea
,
just
west
of
the
line
that
Japan
regards
as
its
border
.
Japan
protested
,
to
no
avail
,
that
the
project
should
be
a
joint
one
.
The
two
are
also
set
to
clash
over
Russia
's
oil
wealth
.
China
is
furious
that
Japan
has
outbid
it
in
their
battle
to
determine
the
route
of
the
pipeline
that
Russia
intends
to
build
to
the
Far
East
.
Japan
favoured
a
route
to
the
sea
,
enabling
oil
to
be
shipped
to
both
Japan
and
China
.
Increasingly
,
analysts
are
saying
that
China
's
efforts
have
gone
beyond
what
is
safe
or
even
in
its
own
interests
.
Claude
Mandil
,
the
executive
director
of
the
International
Energy
Agency
in
Paris
,
said
the
reserves
in
the
East
China
Sea
were
hardly
worth
the
trouble
.
Nobody
thinks
that
there
will
be
a
lot
of
oil
and
gas
in
this
part
of
the
world
,
he
said
.
It
may
be
a
difficult
political
issue
but
I
do
n't
think
the
energy
content
is
worthwhile
.
Eurasia
Group
,
a
New
York
-
based
firm
of
political
analysts
,
said
its
oil
experts
worked
out
that
China
was
paying
such
an
inflated
price
for
its
investment
in
Brazil
that
the
cost
for
the
oil
it
ended
up
with
was
three
times
the
market
price
.
If
China
's
economy
falters
,
which
,
in
my
view
,
appears
increasingly
likely
,
then
commodity
prices
will
plummet
,
and
with
them
,
the
value
of
the
assets
that
produce
them
,
Jason
Kindopp
,
Eurasia
's
lead
China
analyst
,
said
.
China
's
wider
aggression
to
secure
oil
and
gas
was
the
greatest
threat
to
its
international
standing
in
the
next
decade
.
Sudan
is
the
primary
example
,
he
said

Meditation
has
to
do
with
what
is
called
ideation
.
Find
a
comfortable
place
on
the
floor
and
sit
with
your
legs
crossed
.
Place
your
hands
one
on
top
of
the
other
in
your
lap
,
keep
your
back
straight
,
keep
eyes
closed
and
keep
tongue
on
the
roof
of
your
mouth
.
Your
breathing
should
be
calm
and
relaxed
,
through
the
nose
.
Spend
a
minute
or
so
concentrating
on
your
breath
,
feeling
the
air
flowing
through
your
nostrils
.
1
.
Warm
Sun
Visualization
Continue
to
breathe
slowly
and
deeply
.
With
each
breath
,
feel
the
muscles
in
your
body
becoming
lighter
and
lighter
,
and
also
your
external
motor
and
sensory
organs
are
feeling
like
they
are
withdrawing
from
the
world
into
a
special
inner
quietness
.
Imagine
the
tension
melting
away
as
you
continue
breathing
rhythmically
and
naturally
.
Picture
yourself
sitting
on
a
warm
,
tropical
beach
basking
in
the
glow
of
the
sun
...
.
Visualize
the
vivid
,
beautiful
colours
of
the
earth
(
its
flowers
and
plants
)
,
the
sea
next
to
you
,
and
the
sky
above
you
.
Feel
yourself
floating
above
the
earth
and
sea
.
As
you
sit
above
the
world
,
the
warmth
of
the
golden
sun
penetrates
your
body
and
makes
you
feel
warmer
and
warmer
.
It
surrounds
you
.
The
golden
rays
feel
soft
and
soothing
.
Now
you
are
far
above
the
earth
-
into
space
.
Everything
around
you
is
so
vast
.
Yet
,
there
is
warmth
and
a
familiarity
with
the
vastness
.
You
want
to
merge
your
mind
with
the
greater
universal
Mind
that
surrounds
you
.
Continue
to
ideate
on
this
intense
desire
for
your
mind
to
merge
with
the
that
universal
Consciousness
.
And
while
doing
so
continue
using
the
Baba
Nam
Kevalam
mantra
(
breathe
in
with
Baba
Nam
,
breathe
out
with
Kevalam
)
.
Try
this
for
5
to
10
minutes
.
Now
come
back
to
earth
again
-
slowly
.
Imagine
yourself
sitting
on
the
beach
serenely
and
restfully
.
Your
muscles
are
loose
and
limp
.
Feel
your
body
sinking
slightly
into
the
sand
making
that
earthly
connection
again
.
The
sun
's
rays
and
warmth
are
still
with
you
,
surrounding
you
.
You
are
in
a
state
of
peace
and
relaxation
.
With
each
breath
,
watch
your
body
and
ensure
that
it
remains
relaxed
-
at
peace
.
Continue
to
feel
the
warmth
of
the
sunlight
all
over
your
body
,
warming
you
deeply
and
gently
.
You
want
to
bring
something
back
with
you
from
your
deep
space
experience
where
you
sensed
your
mind
merging
with
the
universal
Mind
.
This
will
be
the
warmth
of
the
sun
-
a
close
reminder
and
link
between
earth
and
the
infinite
space
.
Visualize
the
inside
of
your
body
bathed
in
the
golden
light
,
absorbing
every
ray
and
glowing
as
radiantly
as
the
sun
.
A
warm
,
gentle
breeze
swirls
around
your
body
and
relaxes
you
even
more
.
Let
your
mind
and
body
be
totally
at
peace
.
Open
your
eyes
.

.
Mountain
Visualization
Another
thing
you
can
try
.
Imagine
you
're
sitting
on
top
of
a
mountain
,
and
that
it
's
the
most
peaceful
place
you
can
think
of
.
Feel
that
you
're
sitting
there
in
complete
peace
,
right
on
top
of
the
world
.
Now
imagine
that
infinite
happiness
is
surrounding
you
in
every
direction
.
Feel
you
're
completely
surrounded
by
that
infinite
peace
and
happiness
.
Now
start
to
repeat
within
your
mind
the
mantra
:
BABA
NAM
KEVALAM
.
Its
meaning
is
"
Infinite
happiness
is
everywhere
"
.
Feel
the
meaning
,
do
n't
just
think
of
its
wordy
meaning
or
try
to
translate
from
Sanskrit
(
BABA
NAM
KEVALAM
)
to
an
English
meaning
(
Infinite
peace
and
happiness
)
.
Think
internally
,
intuitively
,
not
by
words
,
of
the
meaning
,
as
you
're
repeating
it
.
This
is
called
ideation
.
It
is
important
to
take
the
idea
,
not
just
the
intellectual
analysis
.
Touching
deep
into
the
idea
is
what
builds
intuition
-
it
is
a
synthetic
process
.
Feel
you
're
surrounded
by
infinite
peace
and
happiness
,
and
feel
that
your
own
sense
of
existence
is
in
direct
contact
with
that
endless
peace
and
happiness
all
around
you
.
You
can
go
further
and
feel
that
your
unit
consciousness
,
a
dot
in
the
Infinite
Consciousness
,
is
merging
with
Infinity
.
Continue
for
as
long
as
you
like
,
then
open
your
eyes
.
OK
that
is
fairly
basic
:)
.
The
important
point
is
to
develop
some
psycho-spiritual
connection
between
your
mind
and
the
universal
Consciousness
or
Supreme
Consciousness
.
Do
n't
worry
if
you
have
trouble
concentrating
on
the
mantra
and
ideation
-
that
's
normal
.
It
takes
some
time
and
practice
to
be
able
to
focus
on
the
one
thought
.
The
main
thing
is
to
keep
practicing
.
If
you
do
n't
practice
,
then
nothing
happens
.

NORTH
CAROLINA
RELIGIOUS
COALITION
FOR
MARRIAGE
EQUALITY
From
what
we
hear
from
the
news
media
,
one
could
easily
conclude
that
all
Christians
are
opposed
to
gay
marriage
.
But
that
â€™s
not
the
case
.
Last
year
an
organization
named
the
North
Carolina
Religious
Coalition
for
Marriage
Equality
was
formed
to
get
out
the
message
that
at
least
some
people
of
faith
are
not
opposed
to
extending
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
civil
marriage
to
same
-
gender
couples
.
One
of
â€œ
NCRC4ME
â€™s
â€
major
efforts
is
to
collect
signatures
for
the
attached
â€œ
Declaration
of
Religious
Leaders
,
â€
which
has
been
and
will
again
be
presented
to
members
of
the
NC
legislature
.
A
measure
to
amend
the
NC
Constitution
to
ban
gay
marriage
was
defeated
last
year
but
already
has
been
reintroduced
in
the
2005
legislative
session
,
so
there
is
a
real
need
for
visible
support
for
the
â€œ
pro-same
-
gender
-
marriage
â€
side
of
this
issue
.
At
its
February
meeting
the
CHS
Vestry
voted
unanimously
to
add
their
names
to
the
Declaration
.
Our
Rector
Barbara
and
our
Deacon
Clare
also
have
signed
the
Declaration
.
Furthermore
,
the
Vestry
voted
unanimously
to
invite
the
support
of
members
of
the
CHS
congregation
for
the
Declaration
.
(
Since
the
Declaration
is
written
as
coming
from
â€œ
religious
leaders
,
â€
people
who
do
nâ€™t
consider
themselves
â€œ
religious
leaders
â€
can
sign
as
â€œ
Supporters
of
the
North
Carolina
Religious
Coalition
for
Marriage
Equality
.
â€
)
If
you
have
any
questions
please
feel
free
to
call
me
(
after
Sat.
the
26th
,
when
I
will
return
from
a
trip
)
.
Sign
-
up
lists
will
be
available
at
the
services
on
Feb.
27
and
March
6
,
or
you
can
email
me
.
I
will
email
names
and
email
addresses
(
or
postal
addresses
)
of
signers
to
NCRC4ME
in
time
for
their
â€œ
lobby
day
â€
in
Raleigh
on
March
15
.
Thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
this
issue

North
Carolina
Religious
Coalition
for
Marriage
Equality
Declaration
of
Religious
Leaders
April
19
,
2004
We
become
most
fully
human
when
we
love
another
person
.
We
can
grow
in
our
capacity
to
be
human
-
to
be
loving
-
in
a
family
unit
.
Throughout
history
,
tyrants
have
known
that
by
denying
the
right
of
oppressed
peoples
to
form
and
nurture
families
,
they
can
kill
the
spirit
of
those
peoples
.
>
From
the
shameful
history
of
slavery
in
America
,
the
injustice
of
forbidding
people
to
marry
is
evident
as
a
denial
of
a
basic
human
right
.
The
American
laws
forbidding
interracial
marriage
,
now
struck
down
,
were
clearly
discriminatory
.
Denial
of
the
status
of
marriage
to
those
who
would
freely
accept
its
responsibilities
creates
legal
and
economic
inequities
and
social
injustice
.
We
feel
called
to
protest
and
oppose
this
injustice
.
As
religious
people
,
clergy
and
lay
leaders
,
we
are
mandated
by
faith
to
stand
for
justice
in
our
common
civic
life
.
We
oppose
the
use
of
sacred
texts
and
religious
traditions
to
deny
legal
equity
to
same
-
gender
couples
.
As
concerned
citizens
we
affirm
the
liberty
of
adults
of
the
same
gender
to
love
and
marry
.
We
insist
that
no
one
,
especially
the
state
,
is
allowed
to
coerce
people
into
marriage
or
bar
two
consenting
adults
,
whether
of
the
same
or
differing
genders
,
from
forming
the
family
unit
that
lets
them
be
more
fully
loving
,
thus
more
fully
human
.
We
respect
the
fact
that
debate
and
discussion
continue
in
many
of
our
religious
communities
as
to
the
scriptural
,
theological
and
liturgical
issues
involved
.
However
,
we
draw
on
our
many
faith
traditions
to
arrive
at
a
common
conviction
.
We
affirm
freedom
of
conscience
in
this
matter
.
As
faith
leaders
,
we
commit
ourselves
to
public
action
,
visibility
,
education
,
and
mutual
support
in
the
service
of
the
right
and
freedom
to
marry
.

The
One
Reason
Why
All
Americans
Should
Oppose
The
Nomination
Of
Samuel
Alito
He
Would
Tear
Down
Our
System
Of
Checks
And
Balances
,
Giving
Far
Too
Much
Power
To
The
President
My
Fellow
Americans
:
A
copy
of
the
Constitution
,
with
links
back
to
the
official
source
,
is
located
at
http://loveallpeople.org/usconstitutiona.txt
Judge
Samuel
Alito
is
very
highly
qualified
by
all
of
the
normal
standards
used
to
evaluate
candidates
for
this
position
:
He
has
a
very
high
intellect
.
He
graduated
very
high
in
his
class
,
from
Princeton
undergraduate
and
from
Law
School
at
Yale
.
He
has
a
long
and
distinguished
record
,
including
many
years
as
a
Federal
Appeals
Judge
,
the
next
level
below
Supreme
Court
.
He
has
encyclopedic
knowledge
of
hundreds
of
different
Supreme
Court
cases
,
and
he
can
recite
details
from
memory
.
He
demonstrates
an
excellent
"
Judicial
Temperament
,
"
being
courteous
,
mild
-
mannered
,
respectful
of
all
people
;
careful
in
his
work
,
meticulous
in
detail
.
His
fellow
judges
love
him
.
His
family
loves
him
.
President
Bush
loves
him
.
Yes
,
it
is
true
that
some
people
do
n't
like
the
way
they
think
he
will
vote
on
the
Supreme
Court
.
But
other
people
do
like
the
way
they
think
he
will
vote
,
and
the
ones
who
favor
him
seem
to
outnumber
the
ones
who
oppose
him
.
So
now
the
Senate
is
getting
ready
to
vote
soon
,
on
whether
to
approve
him
or
not
;
and
at
this
moment
(
evening
of
Jan.
27
,
2006
)
it
looks
like
he
has
more
than
the
fifty
-
one
votes
needed
for
approval
.
The
President
is
very
eager
to
go
ahead
quickly
and
get
this
vote
,
because
he
very
much
wants
to
have
Samuel
Alito
on
the
Supreme
Court
,
to
be
judging
the
cases
Bush
is
interested
in
.
So
there
is
a
lot
of
hurry
-
up
pressure
on
the
Senate
to
give
its
prompt
vote
of
approval
.
There
is
an
old
saying
that
applies
in
this
situation
:
"
Act
in
haste
,
repent
at
leisure
.
"
Sometimes
you
can
make
a
bad
decision
very
quickly
,
then
regret
it
for
many
years
to
come
.
That
is
what
is
about
to
happen
with
Judge
Samuel
Alito
,
in
my
opinion
,
because
he
has
one
tragic
flaw
-
a
very
serious
blind
spot
in
his
thinking
-
which
makes
him
completely
unacceptable
for
the
position
of
Supreme
Court
Justice
:
He
does
not
really
agree
with
the
system
of
"
Checks
and
Balances
"
built
into
the
Constitution
,
and
he
is
ready
to
start
tearing
it
down
in
order
to
follow
the
"
Unitary
Executive
Theory
,
"
which
calls
for
vastly
-
increased
Presidential
Power
at
the
expense
of
Congress
and
the
Supreme
Court
.
And
because
of
this
tragic
flaw
.
.
.
He
Would
Tear
Down
Our
System
Of
Checks
And
Balances
,
Giving
Far
Too
Much
Power
To
The
President
.
In
our
Constitutional
system
,
we
have
three
branches
of
the
Federal
Government
:
the
Legislative
,
Executive
,
and
Judicial
branches
.
And
the
basic
idea
behind
the
Checks
and
Balances
we
have
is
that
if
one
branch
of
the
Government
goes
crazy
,
the
other
two
can
hold
it
down
.
But
Samuel
Alito
believes
in
a
little
-
known
Constitutional
theory
-
called
the
"
Unitary
Executive
Theory
"
-
which
says
that
the
President
should
have
complete
control
over
the
Executive
Branch
,
and
that
the
Executive
Branch
should
be
in
charge
of
almost
everything
that
the
Government
actually
does
,
including
the
functions
of
the
Independent
Agencies
which
were
designed
to
be
free
of
Presidential
control
,
and
the
Military
,
which
exists
,
which
is
regulated
,
and
which
is
funded
by
specific
authority
given
by
the
Constitution
to
Congress
,
not
to
the
President
.
The
Military
is
not
part
of
the
Executive
Branch
:
it
is
a
separate
entity
.
Commander
In
Chief
does
n't
mean
that
he
is
the
boss
of
the
Military
,
merely
mean
that
he
is
the
Administrator
,
just
as
he
is
the
Administrator
of
the
Executive
Branch
,
charged
with
"
executing
faithfully
"
all
the
laws
passed
by
Congress
and
all
the
Decisions
rendered
by
the
Supreme
Court
.
Under
the
Unitary
Executive
Theory
,
the
Laws
of
Congress
and
Decisions
of
the
Supreme
Court
have
no
actual
authority
unless
the
President
agrees
with
them
.
And
so
Congress
and
the
Supreme
Court
become
mere
advisors
to
the
President
,
with
no
real
authority
over
him
.
And
the
President
becomes
a
Dictator
,
unrestrained
by
anything
in
the
Constitution
,
backed
up
by
the
Armed
Forces
,
which
would
be
entirely
under
his
personal
control
.

China
launched
Shenzhou
VI
,
its
second
manned
spacecraft
,
early
today
in
northwest
China
's
Gansu
Province
.
A
pair
of
military
pilots
embarked
on
China
's
second
manned
space
flight
early
today
,
hurtling
into
orbit
on
a
test
mission
that
could
span
five
days
.
The
crew
of
the
Shenzhou
VI
spacecraft
was
identified
as
Fei
Junlong
,
40
,
and
Nie
Haishen
,
41
,
by
China
's
official
news
agency
.
The
successful
launch
from
the
Jiuquan
Satellite
Launch
Center
in
northwest
China
follows
the
solo
flight
of
Yang
Liwei
in
October
2003
.
Most
experts
believe
China
intends
to
develop
a
small
space
station
of
its
own
over
the
next

have
been
thwarted
for
more
than
a
decade
over
a
range
of
issues
,
including
the
Asian
country
's
human
rights
policies
and
worries
it
could
acquire
technologies
that
could
pose
a
security
threat
.
The
freeze
thawed
some
after
Yang
's
2003
mission
.
China
was
among
30
nations
invited
to
send
a
delegate
to
NASA
-
sponsored
roundtable
discussions
on
Bush
's
strategy
to
reach
the
moon
with
astronauts
as
the
first
step
in
the
exploration
of
Mars
and
other
-
deep
space
destinations
.
We
wish
them
a
successful
return
of
their
astronauts
.
He
stressed
,
however
,
that
NASA
would
not
follow
this
week
's
Chinese
mission
through
formal
channels
.
The
flight
of
Fei
and
Nie
could
mark
the
end
of
the
opening
chapter
in
a
three
-
phase
Chinese
space
initiative
,
Johnson
-
Freese
said
.
The
first
phase
,
she
said
,
will
demonstrate
the
capability
of
a
multi-compartment
spacecraft
that
will
leave
a
test
module
in
orbit
when
the
two
fliers
return
to
Earth
.
The
final
phase
will
feature
the
assembly
and
operation
of
a
longer
-
duration
space
lab
.
At
least
one
expert
believes
China
's
intentions
might
include
a
surprise
attempt
to
circle
the
moon
with
astronauts
before
NASA
's
planned
lunar
return
.
The
Americans
would
be
wise
to
plan
accordingly

the
U.S.
and
Russian
lunar
race
during
the
Cold
War
,
NASA
scored
an
early
coup
by
circling
the
moon
with
the
Apollo
8
crew
over
the
1968
Christmas
holidays
.
(
China
)
could
be
the
second
country
to
do
that
,
Pike
said
.
And
they
would
not
have
to
land
on
the
moon
to
take
us
down
a
notch
.
"
Pike
's
concern
is
based
on
China
's
development
of
a
new
medium
-
lift
rocket
,
the
Long
March
V
,
and
the
construction
of
a
new
space
launch
complex
on
Hainan
Island
in
the
South
China
Sea
.
The
two
developments
,
he
said
,
could
eventually
enable
China
's
space
program
to
mature
to
the
point
that
experts
could
assemble
and
launch
from
Earth
's
orbit
a
spacecraft
capable
of
circling
the
moon
with
astronauts
and
returning
home

I
'm
a
member
of
a
local
animal
rights
news
,
and
get
regular
emails
from
other
members
and
the
staff
.
Recently
,
I
read
an
email
that
reported
the
horrific
nightmare
Civet
Cats
go
through
by
sick
losers
who
put
them
in
sheds
and
heat
the
inside
of
the
sheds
up
to
110
degrees
with
fires
,
so
that
they
can
periodically
scrape
the
sweat
off
of
their
genitals
and
sell
it
to
corrupt
corporations
who
use
it
to
prolong
the
scent
of
perfumes
.
The
animals
eventually
die
,
which
is
because
these
demons
are
so
GREEDY
,
they
want
as
much
of
their
"
product
"
as
they
can
get
,
instead
of
letting
the
cats
go
after
a
point
,
as
an
act
of
humanity
,
mercy
,
love
.
Below
I
pasted
the
email
text
,
and
it
has
a
link
to
a
website
that
automatically
plays
this
song
the
author
of
the
email
created
.
Right
now
,
while
we
're
sitting
at
our
computers
enjoying
the
internet
,
those
innocent
,
beautiful
,
loving
cats
,
are
dying
,
somewhere
in
this
troubled
world
a
slow
,
agonizing
death
.
The
main
reason
I
wrote
this
post
is
to
ask
anyone
reading
this
if
they
know
of
some
way
I
can
help
put
a
stop
to
this
Cat
Holocaust
.
I
am
serious
about
doing
something
.
If
I
love
cats
so
much
,
why
are
n't
I
DOING
something
???
I
do
n't
want
to
appear
before
God
on
judgment
day
and
have
to
explain
why
I
did
n't
do
anything
like
this
in
my
life
.
Any
suggestions
would
be
appreciated
.
Here
's
the
text
of
the
email
:
Hi
there
,
I
read
the
Civet
Cat
story
from
a
little
while
ago
,
and
tonight
,
when
my
Mom
emailed
me
about
it
,
I
re-read
it
,
and
went
to
the
website
with
the
song
the
author
of
the
email
created
.
So
,
if
anyone
can
give
me
some
advice
,
I
'd
sure
appreciate
it
!
I
think
for
starters
,
myself
and
those
of
you
who
believe
in
God
could
say
a
special
prayer
for
them
.
I
will
.
I
've
pasted
the
email
for
those
who
have
n't
seen
or
would
like
to
re-read
it
.
It
's
also
got
the
website
where
the
song
has
been
uploaded
.
I
was
thinking
,
that
while
I
'm
sitting
here
,
relaxing
and
enjoying
myself
,
those
poor
innocent
animals
are
being
cooked
to
death
with
heat
in
those
Holocaust-esque
death
chambers
.
And
what
am
I
DOING
about
it
?

James
Rachels
+
a
song
This
is
my
first
time
posting
to
the
list
,
so
I
feel
somewhat
embarrassed
by
"
promoting
"
a
song
I
wrote
,
but
I
think
it
is
fitting
because
it
is
directly
tied
to
extreme
animal
suffering
as
a
result
of
human
lack
of
empathy
,
but
an
abundance
of
human
greed
.
I
'm
not
sure
if
any
of
you
know
much
about
civet
cats
,
but
to
brief
those
who
might
not
know
,
I
will
quote
James
Rachels
,
author
of
World
Hunger
and
Moral
Obligation
among
many
other
animal
rights
-
related
books
and
articles
.
(
I
kind
of
see
him
to
be
for
animal
rights
theory
as
Peter
Singer
is
to
the
theory
of
utilitarianism
applied
to
non-human
animals
)
.
The
quote
is
from
an
article
entitled
"
Vegetarianism
and
`
The
Other
Weight
Problem
'
"
If
anyone
wants
the
complete
article
,
email
me
,
as
it
is
a
very
good
article
which
no
meat
-
eater
can
read
and
not
sense
their
own
hypocrisy
.
But
this
is
what
he
says
about
civet
cats
:
As
an
example
,
consider
the
treatment
of
the
civet
cat
,
a
highly
intelligent
and
sociable
animal
.
As
an
example
,
consider
the
treat
@@ment
of
the
civet
cat
,
a
high
@@ly
intelligent
and
sociable
animal
.
Civet
cats
are
trapped
and
placed
in
small
cages
inside
darkened
sheds
,
where
the
temperature
is
kept
up
to
110
F
by
fires
.
They
are
confined
in
this
way
until
they
finally
die
.
What
justifies
this
extraordinary
mistreatment
?
These
animals
have
the
misfortune
to
produce
a
substance
that
is
useful
in
the
manufacture
of
perfume
.
Musk
,
which
is
scraped
from
their
genitals
once
a
day
for
as
long
as
they
can
surv
ive
,
makes
the
scent
of
perfume
last
a
bit
longer
after
each
application
.
(
The
heat
increases
their
"
production
"
of
musk
.
)
Here
Kant
's
rule
--
"
Animals
are
merely
means
to
an
end
;
that
end
is
man
"
--
is
applied
with
a
vengeance
.
This
article
,
and
specifically
this
piece
,
effected
me
enough
to
try
to
build
a
song
around
the
topic
.
If
anyone
is
interested
in
listening
to
this
song
,
and
in
offering
their
opinion
,
whether
it
be
positive
or
negative
,
I
'd
appreciate
it
.
But
I
also
hope
no
one
feels
any
obligation
to
download
,
especially
if
you
have
an
internet
connection
as
slow
mine
(
28
k
)
.
The
url
for
the
song
is
http://www.sonic.net/~fsjob/TragiCore-TheCivetCat.mp3
Although
there
are
no
human
vocals
/
lyrics
,
I
think
it's
subject
matter
is
audible
.
Again
,
if
anyone
wants
to
read
Rachels
'
entire
article
,
let
me
know
.
It
's
also
on
the
net
.
I
was
already
a
vegetarian
when
I
read
it
a
little
more
than
a
year
ago
,
but
it
was
one
of
the
bigger
factors
for
me
in
going
completely
vegan
.
I
hope
all
are
well
.
Farewell
for
now

THIS
IS
NOT
A
SCAM
!!!
I
found
this
on
a
bulletin
board
and
decided
to
try
it
:
I
do
n't
care
about
the
useless
pre-fabricated
crap
this
message
usually
says
.
All
I
say
is
,
it
works
.
Continue
pre-fab
crap
.
WELL
GUESS
WHAT
!!!
Within
seven
days
,
I
started
getting
money
in
the
mail
!!
I
was
shocked
!!
I
figured
it
would
end
soon
,
but
the
money
just
kept
coming
in
.
In
my
first
week
,
I
made
about
$
25.00
.
By
the
end
of
the
second
week
I
had
made
a
total
of
more
than
$
1000.00
!!
In
the
third
week
I
had
more
than
$
10,000.00
and
it
's
still
growing
!!
This
is
now
my
fourth
week
and
I
have
made
a
total
of
$
42,000.00
and
it
's
still
coming
rapidly
.
It
's
certainly
worth
$
6.00
and
six
stamps
,
and
I
have
spent
more
than
that
on
the
lottery
without
ever
winning
!!!
Let
me
tell
you
how
this
works
and
most
important
,
why
it
works
..........
also
make
sure
you
print
this
out
NOW
,
so
you
can
get
the
information
off
of
it
,
as
you
will
need
it
.
I
promise
you
that
if
you
follow
the
directions
exactly
that
you
will
start
making
more
money
than
you
thought
possible
by
doing
something
so
easy
!!
Suggestion
:
Read
this
entire
message
carefully
!!
(
Print
it
out
or
download
it
)
Follow
the
simple
directions
and
watch
the
money
come
in
!!
It
's
easy
.
It
's
legal
.
And
,
your
investment
is
only
$
6.00
(
Plus
postage
)
!!!
IMPORTANT
:
This
is
not
a
rip
-
off
,
it
is
decent
;
it
's
legal
;
and
it
is
virtually
no
risk
-
it
really
works
!!
If
all
the
following
instructions
are
adhered
to
,
you
will
receive
extraordinary
dividends
.
PLEASE
NOTE
:
Please
follow
the
directions
EXACTLY
,
and
$
50,000
or
more
can
be
yours
in
20
to
60
days
.
This
program
remains
successful
because
of
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
the
participants
.
Please
continue
its
success
by
carefully
adhering
to
the
instructions
.
You
will
now
become
a
part
of
the
Mail
Order
business
.
You
are
in
the
business
of
developing
Mailing
Lists
.
Many
large
corporations
are
happy
to
pay
big
bucks
for
quality
lists
.
However
,
the
money
made
from
the
mailing
lists
is
secondary
to
income
which
is
made
from
people
like
you
and
me
asking
to
be
included
in
that
list
.
Here
are
the
four
easy
steps
to
success
.
STEP
ONE
:
Get
six
separate
pieces
of
paper
and
write
the
following
on
each
piece
of
paper
"
PLEASE
PUT
ME
ON
YOUR
MAILING
LIST
.
"
Now
get
6
U.S.
$
1.00
bills
and
place
ONE
inside
of
EACH
of
the
six
pieces
of
paper
so
the
bill
will
not
be
seen
through
the
envelope
(
to
prevent
thievery
)
.
Next
,
place
one
paper
in
each
of
the
six
envelopes
and
seal
them
.
You
now
should
have
six
sealed
envelopes
,
each
with
a
piece
of
paper
stating
the
above
phrase
,
your
name
and
address
,
and
a
$
1.00
bill
.
What
you
are
doing
is
creating
a
service
.
THIS
IS
ABSOLUTELY
LEGAL
!!!!
!
You
are
requesting
a
legitimate
service
and
you
are
paying
for
it
!!
Like
most
of
us
I
was
a
little
skeptical
and
little
worried
about
the
legal
aspects
of
it
all
.
So
I
checked
it
out
with
the
U.S.
Post
Office
(
1-800-238-5355
)
and
they
confirmed
that
it
is
indeed
legal
!!
Mail
the
six
envelopes
to
the
following
addresses

STEP
TWO
:
Now
take
the
#
1
name
off
the
list
that
you
see
above
,
move
the
other
names
up
(
six
becomes
5
,
5
becomes
4
,
and
etc.
)
and
add
YOUR
NAME
as
number
6
on
the
list
.
STEP
THREE
:
Change
anything
you
need
to
but
try
to
keep
this
article
as
close
to
original
as
possible
.
Now
post
your
amended
article
to
at
least
200
news
groups
.
:
(
I
think
there
are
close
to
24,000
groups
)
All
you
need
is
200
,
but
remember
,
the
more
you
post
,
the
more
money
you
make
!!
This
is
perfectly
legal
!!
If
you
have
any
doubts
,
refer
to
Title
18
Sec.
1302
&
1341
of
the
Postal
Lottery
laws
.
Keep
a
copy
of
these
steps
for
yourself
and
whenever
you
need
money
,
you
can
use
it
again
,
and
again
.
PLEASE
REMEMBER
that
this
program
remains
successful
because
of
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
the
participants
and
by
their
carefully
adhering
to
directions
.
Look
at
it
this
way
.
If
you
were
of
integrity
,
the
program
will
continue
and
the
money
that
so
many
others
have
received
will
come
your
way
.
NOTE
:
You
may
want
to
retain
every
name
and
address
sent
to
you
,
either
on
a
computer
or
hard
copy
and
keep
the
notes
people
send
you
.
This
VERIFIES
that
you
are
truly
providing
a
service
.
(
Also
,
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
wrap
the
$
1
bill
in
dark
paper
to
reduce
the
risk
of
mail
theft
)
.
So
,
as
each
post
is
downloaded
and
the
directions
carefully
followed
,
all
members
will
be
reimbursed
for
their
participation
as
a
List
Developer
with
one
dollar
each
.
What
an
opportunity
for
only
$
6.00
(
$
1.00
for
each
of
the
first
six
people
listed
above
)
Send
it
now
,
add
your
own
name
to
the
list
and
you
're
in
business

Western
sheep

on

off
as
a
job
well
done
.
Their
sheep
could
graze
,
their
cows
could
ruminate
and
never
a
discouraging
word
would
be
heard
.
After
the
major
kill
-
offs
,
wolves
outside
of
Alaska
and
Canada
existed
mostly
as
legend
.
Like
UFOs
or
Sasquatch
,
several
people
claimed
to
see
fleeting
lone
wolves
,
usually
in
Yellowstone
.
If
so
,
this
happy
band
has
not
been
heard
from
since
.
If
true
,
the
caper
failed
.
Over
time
,
the
wolf
's
absence
seemed
to
rehabilitate
its
image
.
This
trickle
grew
into
a
flood
,
resulting
in
14
wolves
being
reintroduced
in
Yellowstone
in
1995
by
the
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
--
albeit
over
the
strong
and
still
-
continuing
objections
of
ranchers
.
One
compelling
argument
for
reintroduction
was
the
wolf
acts
as
a
keystone
predator
,
an
animal
that
affects
the
populations
,
behavior
and
ecology
of
a
wide
variety
of
species
within
its
range
.
Some
recent
research
conducted
by
Oregon
State
University
has
given
considerable
credence
to
this
idea
.
They
explained
that
elk
in
Yellowstone
used
to
browse
unmolested
on
young
aspen
and
willow
growing
near
the
banks
of
streams
,
a
behavior
that
prevented
the
saplings
from
reaching
mature
stages
and
increased
the
possibility
of
soil
erosion
.
Since
reintroduction
,
however
,
Ripple
and
Beschta
have
found
,
fear
of
the
wolves
apparently
has
discouraged
the
elk
from
spending
too
much
time
at
stream
banks
--
where
they
are
out
in
the
open
--
and
munching
on
the
saplings
.
All
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
photographs
,
Ed
Bangs
,
wolf
recovery
coordinator
for
the
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
,
told
UPI
's
Blue
Planet
,
You

,
'
wow

'
You

An
area
that
used
to
be
bald
as
a
billiard
ball
is

a
sea

willow

"
This
simple
change
has
triggered
a
veritable
ecological
cascade
in
Yellowstone
.
Where
there
had
been
only
one
beaver
colony
in
the
park
's
northern
range
before
the
wolves
returned
,
now
there
are
nine
.
It
may
be
uninteresting
to
a
lot
of
people
,
Beschta
told
Blue

.
There
's
a
lot
of

and
they

'
Who

But
we
've
been
looking
at
streamside

Since
wolf

,
streamside
plants
,
willows
and
cottonwoods
provide
food
for
other
critters
--
beavers
,
a
whole
variety
of
avian
species
,
berry
-
producing
shrubs
that
bears
can
use
.
It
's
important
with
regard
to
the
quality
of
streams
.
The
plants
provide
shade
and
root
strength
for
bank
stability
.
Plants

critical
to
wildland
ecosystems
.
"
Yellowstone
has
a
vast
elk
herd
,
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
.
Bangs
said
although
the
number
of
elk
has
not
declined
very
much
since
the
wolves
came
back
,
their
behavior
appears
markedly
different
.
I
'm
pretty
suspicious
of
making
broad
generalizations
,
however
,
he
cautioned
.
Wolves
are
still
pretty
new
.
Wolf

are
still
pretty
new
.
They
've
only
been
there
for
10
years
.
Some
conservationists
want
the
protection
extended
so
wolves
can
move
into
other
states
,
including
Colorado
,
Utah
and
Oregon
,
among
others
.
On
Jan.
31
,
Oregon
Federal
District
Court
Judge
Robert
E.
Jones
appeared
to
agree
with
them
.
He
vacated
the
FWS
decision
to
downgrade
the
wolf
's
status
.
Bangs
said
his
agency
is
still
reviewing
the
decision
.
Wolves
can
migrate
considerable
distances
.
A
Yellowstone
wolf
was
found
dead
,
hit
by
a
car
,
on
a
Colorado
highway
last
year
,
several
hundred
miles
from
home
.
Meanwhile
,
his
reputation
seems
to
be
improving
,
although
Bangs
noted
a
"
pretty
interesting
social
dynamic
.
"
It
remains
to
be
seen
whether
they
will
extend
the
same
courtesy
to
the
arriving
gray
wolf
.
Regarding
those
rumors
about
wolves
living
in
Yellowstone
prior
to
the
official
reintroduction
?
They
seem
to
be
just
that
:
rumors
.
It
also
is
likely
people
have
released
some
of
these
animals
into
the
wild
hoping
they
would
survive
--
for
instance
,
a
ranger
in
Glacier
Park
caught
someone
in
this
very
act
not
long
ago
.
Bangs
said
these
animals
are
not
equipped
to
survive
in
the
wild
,
however
,
and
they
all
almost
certainly
have
died

Humans

By

UNITED

Nov.

(
UPI
)
--
Scientists
can
argue
all
they
want
about
how
many
degrees
Celsius
--
or
Fahrenheit
--
the
planet
is
warming
and
what
the
trend
portends
,
but
meanwhile
Earth
's
plants
,
insects
and
animals
are
not
waiting
for
the
outcome
.
They
already
are
altering
their
patterns
of
behavior
in
response
to
what
is
happening
.
It
turns
out
one
of
the
surest
barometers
of
the
warming
climate
is
the
response
of
the
non-human
natural
world
to
changing
conditions
,
and
biologists
who
study
the
responses
have
been
aware
for
some
years
the
biosphere
is
acknowledging
global
warming
.
Phenology
studies
an
organism
's
development
and
life
cycle
--
the
pulse
of
life
.
Bradley
's
record
of
300
phenophases
found
that
even
prior
to
1999
,
spring
was
arriving
in
higher
latitudes
several
weeks
earlier
than
in
the
earlier
years
of
her
data
.
The
Eastern
phoebe
is
showing
up
about
20
days
before
it
used
to
.
The
forest
phlox
is
blooming
in
late
April
instead
of
mid-May
.
Half
of
the
300
phenophases
Leopold
tracked
showed
a
response
consistent
with
warming
.
In
England
,
the
cuckoo
returns
earlier
.
An
analysis
of
65
bird
species
in
the
United
Kingdom
shows
about
one
-
third
are
laying
their
eggs
four
to
seven
days
earlier
than
they
did
25
years
ago
.
Pew
researchers
looked
at
about
40
studies
that
could
provide
an
assessment
of
whether
climate
was
affecting
biology
.
Half
of
the
studies
provide
strong
evidence
of
a
causal
link
between
the
biological
change
and
climate
change
,
said
Camille
Parmesan
,
a
University
of
Texas
-
Austin
biologist
and
one
of
the
world
's
leading
experts
on
this
issue
.
These
changes
are
occurring
across
all
species
,
Parmesan
told
UPI
's
Climate
.
Parmesan
has
spent
much
of
her
career
studying
the
checkerspot
butterfly
,
which
migrates
between
Mexico
and
southern
California
.
Empirical
research
pointed
to
climate
as
being
a
strong
driver
,
she
said
.
According
to
Parmesan
's
earlier
studies
,
one
extinction
event
,
for
instance
,
was
triggered
when
a
checkerspot
population
migrated
north
prematurely
,
relying
on
a
warming
temperature
signal
,
then
was
caught
in
a
severe
snowstorm
in
its
northern
habitat
.
Tree
swallows
are
nesting
nine
days
earlier
.
Tropical
species
have
moved
up
to
Florida
and
the
Gulf
Coast
.
Bird
and
butterfly
watchers
are
seeing
many
,
many
new
species
coming
up
from
Mexico
and
the
Caribbean
.
"
As
the
Pew
report
concluded
,
"
Sufficient
studies
now
exist
to
conclude
that
the
consequences
of
climate
change
are
already
detectable
within
U.S.
ecosystems
.
"
Such
consequences
include
shifting
and
,
in
some
cases
,
contraction
of
ranges
and
changes
in
species
composition
within
ecosystems
.
The
Alaskan
tundra
,
for
instance
,
has
switched
from
being
a
net
sink
of
carbon
dioxide
--
absorbing
and
storing
more
carbon
from
the
atmosphere
than
it
releases
--
to
"
being
a
net
source
of
CO2
(
releasing
more
carbon
than
is
stored
)
because
warmer
winters
have
allowed
dead
plant
matter
previously
stored
in
the
soil
to
decompose
and
release
CO2
.
"
The
Pew
report
coincided
with
the
release
in
Iceland
of
the
"
Arctic
Climate
Impact
Assessment
.
"
The
impacts
of
global
warming
are
affecting
people
now
in
the
Arctic
,
said
ACIA
chair
Robert
Corell
.
The
Arctic
is
experiencing
some
of
the
most
rapid
and
severe
climate
change
on
Earth
.
The
Arctic
is
experience
@@ing
some
of

most

.
The
impacts
of
climate
change
on
the
region
and
the
globe
are
projected
to
increase
substantially
in
the
years
to
come
.
"
The
ACIA
found
Arctic
winter
temperatures
have
increased
4
degrees
to
7
degrees
Fahrenheit
in
the
last
50
years
and
should
go
up
about
twice
that
much
in
the
next
100
years
.
Arctic
summer
sea
ice
will
decline
by
50
percent
by
the
end
of
the
21st
century
,
the
assessment
found
,
with
some
models
predicting
complete
disappearance
of
summer
sea
ice
.
Should
the
Arctic
Ocean
become
ice
-
free
in
summer
,
it
is
likely
that
polar
bears
and
some
seal
species
would
be
driven
toward
extinction
,
the
report
concluded
.
As
with
so
much
climate
research
,
not
everyone
agrees
with
these
dire
predictions
.
On
the
one
hand
,
the
IPN
report
agreed
"
Climate
models
generally
predict
that
the
temperature
rises
in
the
Arctic
will
substantially
exceed
the
global
rise
.
This
applies
especially
in
the
high
Arctic
where
the
ice
cover
is
expected
to
diminish
substantially
with
the
effect
that
the
surface
absorption
of
solar
radiation
will
greatly
increase
.
"
Hidden
in
this
laundry
list
--
and
in
the
pile
of
studies
examined
by
the
Pew
researchers
--
is
one
of
the
fundamental
chasms
dividing
participants
in
the
global
warming
debate
.
The
IPN
report
examines
commercial
fish
species
,
but
it
neglects
important
non-commercial
animals
,
such
as
seals
and
polar
bears
.
In
a
limited
economic
sense
,
therefore
,
the
organization
can
argue
warming
might
be
a
good
thing
.
The
Pew
researchers
tried
to
transcend
the
economic
argument
.
They
assumed
a
value
--
unspecified
--
for
non-commercial
species
,
and
in
doing
so
rendered
the
warming
news
a
bit
less
rosy
.
This
tug
-
of
-
war
over
calculating
economic
values
is
the
one
that
ultimately
will
have
to
be
decided
by
humans
,
because
animals
and
plants
can
adjust
only
so
much
.
When

when
I
began
traveling
for
business
to
New
England
,
when
I
first
visited
my
in
-
laws
in
Montana
and
Idaho
,
I
was
shocked
at
the
lack
of
racial
diversity
.
I
did
n't
expect
to
react
that
way
,
but
when
I
was
looking
around
my
workplace
in
Nashua
,
New
Hampshire
,
and
everyone
else
looked
pretty
much
like
me
,
it
was
really
very
eerie
.
So
,
yes
,
America
has
pockets
that
are
more
diverse
than
others
.
Unfortunately
,
those
left
behind
to
be
filmed
,
where
those
without
transportation
or
means
.
Some
refused
to
leave
,
but
so
many
were
unable
to
.
Yes
,
it
's
a
valid
reflection
of
America
-
we
do
have
cities
like
this
.
However
,
New
Orleans
also
had
many
affluent
people
,
people
who
left
town
early
as
they
had
the
means
.
I
do
n't
know
if
this
will
change
other
nation
's
perceptions
of
America
.
I
suspect
it
will
not
change
greatly
...
but
you
never
know
how
much
stock
people
put
in
the
news
.
I
do
know
that
this
will
change
the
face
of
America
.
I
expect
that
many
of
the
displaced
people
(
those
affluent
and
those
not
)
will
remain
in
the
places
they
were
evacuated
to
.
Sure
,
some
will
return
,
but
I
have
a
feeling
that
once
many
begin
to
get
jobs
and
temporary
housing
,
they
may
be
shy
about
returning
.
I
'm
interested
in
what
America
will
look
like
in
5
years
.
Will
racial
diversity
find
its
way
to
Wyoming
as
some
people
are
offered
jobs
there
?
Will
the
housing
market
in
Dallas
begin
booming
like
the
rest
of
the
nation
has
due
to
the
influx
of
buyers
?
Will
businesses
that
were
new
in
2005
have
become
a
household
name
due
to
their
efforts
in
rebuilding
the
gulf
coast
?
What
will
the
federal
government
do
to
prevent
inflation
in
the
housing
and
building
market
?
These
are
some
of
the
things
I
've
been
wondering
...

Your
reply
is
good
and

Juggernaut
Okay
,
I
'm
new
to
this
forum
and
really
do
n't
like
Bush
,
so
my
view
point
is
slanted
and
I
admit
that
.
I
rarely
listen
to
the
news
or
to
what
politicians
or
lawyers
say
because
so
many
tell
lies
that
none
have
credibility
so
what
's
the
point
?
What
I
know
is
that
I
have
a
close
friend
who's
aunt
disappeared
in
New
Orleans
.
My
friend
did
n't
have
computer
capability
,
so
I
spent
the
day
searching
and
posting
online
.
The
family
here
(
California
)
wanted
to
fly
any
family
members
from
there
to
CA
,
so
they
could
remain
here
until
things
got
straightened
out
down
there
.
The
cousins
could
not
be
found
because
no
one
was
sure
of
their
married
names
.
The
hope
was
that
anyone
looking
for
the
Aunt
would
see
the
family
post
and
know
that
help
was
available
.
It
is
Oct.
6
,
and
not
one
family
member
has
been
located
.
What
I
saw
was
dozens
of
school
buses
submerged
that
could
have
been
used
to
evacuate
people
who
had
no
transportation
.
What
I
heard
was
the
Mayor
of
New
Orleans
,
saying
that
he
did
n't
order
the
buses
or
anything
else
to
be
used
because
he
was
waiting
on
someone
else
to
tell
him
what
to
do
.
When
common
sense
takes
a
back
seat
to
politics
and
legal
mumbo
jumbo
what
have
we
become
?
Recently
,
Bush
addressed
the
nation
.
About
30
seconds
into
his
address
,
he
started
flogging
the
terrorist
issue
just
one
more
time
.
Ironically
he
almost
burst
out
laughing
and
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
his
mirth
down
to
a
barely
controlled
smirk
.
Even
he
ca
n't
believe
that
he
is
trotting
out
this
old
saw
again
.
I
guess
if
you
have
a
schtick
that
is
a
resounding
success
once
,
you
ca
n't
help
but
trot
it
out
every
time
your
act
is
going
sour
.
Meanwhile
,
every
pocket
that
can
be
lined
is
golden
and
the
poor
are
shunted
off
radar
yet
again
.
The
gall
of
it
all
is
that
Bush
is
stumping
for
more
money
to
build
more
refineries
,
when
what
he
should
do
is
pour
money
into
making
the
US
independent
of
OPEC
or
crude
oil
all
together
.
We
have
the
technology
;
if
you
are
going
to
spend
billions
of
dollars
touting
"
FREEDOM
"
why
not
spend
those
billions
making
all
of
us
free
?
Free
of
polution
,
free
of
oil
dependency
,
and
free
of
big
business
that
is
bleeding
us
dry
for
the
short
term
good
(
theirs
)
.
I
'm
sorry
he
makes
me
want
to
puke
so
I
shut
him
off
.
In
the
meanwhile
there
are
still
broken
families
that
should
have
been
safe
in
the
home
of
the
brave
.
For
those
who
believe
....................
Aries
in
2005
-
Flexibility
2005
will
be
a
year
of
ups
and
downs
,
and
only
the
flexible
will
be
able
to
keep
from
going
crazy
!
All
Aries
natives
may
have
to
tighten
their
belts
and
curb
their
desire
for
constant
expansion
.
You
may
need
to
play
it
cool
and
curb
your
spending
.
You
'll
be
among
the
first
to
seize
upon
new
societal
trends
to
create
new
opportunities
for
yourself
,
as
your
creativity
will
be
at
an
all
-
time
high
.
You
will
be
more
eloquent
and
persuasive
than
usual
,
and
others
will
identify
enthusiastically
with
your
vision
.
If
you
want
to
start
a
new
creative
project
or
business
venture
,
your
imagination
will
be
working
overtime
.
2005
could
find
you
doing
well
career-wise
-
and
aspiring
to
climb
even
higher
.
Taurus
in
2005
-
Tenacity
Diligence
is
the
key
word
for
you
,
Taurus
.
With
hard
work
and
focus
,
you
will
attain
at
least
one
important
aspiration
that
has
been
on
your
agenda
for
a
long
time
.
This
is
the
year
you
'll
want
to
take
stock
of
your
career
and
ask
yourself
if
you
're
doing
the
work
you
want
to
do
for
the
rest
of
your
life
.
As
the
year
progresses
,
the
more
impressive
your
ideas
and
works
become
.
As
a
result
,
your
finances
improve
-
and
your
newfound
confidence
could
attract
new
love
into
your
life
.
By
the
end
of
the
year
,
you
will
have
a
whole
new
network
of
friends
and
group
activity
,
stimulating
new
ideas
and
taking
up
your
social
life
a
notch
or
two
.
Gemini
in
2005
-
Success
Your
cycle
of
learning
through
the
school
of
hard
knocks
has
come
to
an
end
,
Gemini
,
and
now
you
're
going
to
start
reaping
the
rewards
these
"
lessons
"
have
left
in
their
wake
.
As
2005
progresses
,
the
road
ahead
will
become
clearer
.
You
now
have
it
in
you
to
create
the
kind
of
life
for
yourself
that
you
want
.
These
leaps
and
bounds
forward
include
love
and
creativity
.
Your
learning
of
concepts
of
all
kinds
combines
with
extensive
group
activity
,
bringing
your
mind
into
a
whole
new
space
this
year
.
By
the
end
of
2005
you
'll
have
a
whole
new
start
with
regard
to
your
career
and
your
earning
potential
-
and
a
possible
new
partnership
to
top
it
off
!
Cancer
in
2005
-
Balance
For
the
most
part
,
your
outward
life
this
year
will
go
in
fits
and
starts
-
alternating
periods
of
intense
activity
with
times
of
welcome
rest
.
Enjoy
the
restful
periods
when
you
can
.
The
active
ones
will
be
hectic
!
Your
love
life
is
full
,
and
any
dissatisfaction
with
career
and
money
matters
fades
into
the
background
.
By
the
end
of
2005
,
you
'll
feel
more
confident
,
more
determined
,
and
far
more
capable
of
making
the
mountains
come
to
you
!
Leo
in
2005
-
Abundance
The
most
difficult
thing
might
be
deciding
which
path
means
the
most
to
you
,
and
where
to
put
your
focus
.
You
'll
be
able
to
create
opportunities
for
advancement
almost
out
of
thin
air
.
Romance
in
2005
will
make
it
a
year
to
remember
-
and
you
'll
be
the
envy
of
all
your
friends
.
Love
comes
willingly
and
easily
.
Money
may
suddenly
become
tight
at
a
very
inconvenient
time
.
Virgo
in
2005
-
Perseverance
Your
working
life
might
not
go
so
smoothly
this
year
,
Virgo
.
For
much
of
2005
,
you
'll
be
putting
your
nose
to
the
grindstone
.
On
the
bright
side
,
your
finances
will
be
pretty
stable
.
Just
do
n't
take
it
for
granted
-
you
still
need
to
be
cautious
this
year
.
Your
love
life
will
thrive
for
most
of
the
year
,
and
any
relationship
begun
or
reaffirmed
in
2005
is
very
likely
to
be
a
lasting
one
.
And
,
you
're
going
to
develop
a
hopeless
romantic
streak
.
In
spite
of
a
lot
of
worry
over
your
career
,
by
the
year
's
end
,
you
'll
see
that
2005
has
filled
your
life
with
prosperity
and
accomplishments
.
Libra
in
2005
-
Expansion
Flex
your
muscles
,
friend
Libra
,
and
prepare
for
a
relatively
easy
ride
.
With
beneficent
Jupiter
in
your
sign
,
this
is
definitely
your
year
,
especially
where
your
social
life
is
concerned
.
Happiness
and
enjoyment
lie
ahead
.
If
you
're
not
presently
married
,
and
want
to
be
,
you
just
might
wed
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
This
is
the
year
you
're
going
to
be
doing
a
lot
of
travel
and
learning
about
your
world
,
as
expansion
is
the
theme
.
The
one
department
of
life
that
may
not
quite
be
as
hopeful
as
you
'd
like
could
be
your
career
,
where
advancement
may
be
slow
and
satisfaction
rare
.
Scorpio
in
2005
-
Transmutation
Scorpio
,
you
can
still
expect
changes
-
perhaps
major
ones
-
in
your
life
this
year
,
almost
to
the
point
of
total
transformation
.
While
this
is
most
apparent
in
the
area
of
your
career
,
you
'll
see
it
showing
up
in
other
important
aspects
of
your
life
.
Your
life
might
take
on
an
entirely
new
direction
you
've
never
dreamed
of
.
You
may
also
change
your
residence
during
the
year
.
Whether
you
start
the
year
as
a
single
person
looking
for
a
partner
,
or
you
've
been
married
for
many
years
,
happiness
in
love
does
lie
ahead
.
Be
prepared
for
new
horizons
.
They
may
not
be
familiar
,
but
they
will
be
fascinating
.
Do
n't
cling
to
the
banks
;
instead
,
flow
with
the
tide
in
2005
.
Sagittarius
in
2005
-
Empowerment
Are
you
prepared
to
handle
absolute
power
?
If
not
,
you
will
be
soon
!
Your
ruling
planet
,
Jupiter
,
will
be
in
a
special
relationship
with
Pluto
-
called
"
mutual
reception
"
-
in
2005
.
There
's
so
much
punch
packed
into
this
combination
that
it
's
almost
scary
.
You
'll
find
the
ultimate
power
is
the
ability
to
choose
your
own
destiny
.
You
'll
find
practical
ways
of
increasing
your
effectiveness
in
the
world
by
gaining
new
skills
that
allow
you
to
live
more
abundantly
.
By
the
second
half
of
the
year
,
you
will
finally
feel
welcome
relief
from
the
tight
financial
binds
that
have
hindered
you
over
the
past
two
years
.
And
,
a
relationship
you
begin
now
will
last
a
very
long
time
-
like
,
for
the
rest
of
your
life
.
Overall
,
2005
is
sure
to
be
a
year
you
wo
n't
forget
.

of
lucky
breaks
headed
your

in
2005

be
a
lean
year
,

advance
planning
can
help
you
weather
the
storm
.
Your
career
opportunities
will
expand
exponentially
,

likely
to
change
jobs
or
positions
this
year
.

a
big
year
for

out
into

experience
a
new

make
plenty

lucky
breaks
this
year
,
with
Uranus
bringing
the
unexpected
in
your
career
,
your
love
life
,
and
the
world
in
general
.
At
some
point
during
the
year
,
you
could
pick
up
a
financial
windfall
,
hear
of
a
great
career
opportunity
,
or
unexpectedly
meet
the
love
of
your
life
.
It
's
important
that
you
take
retreats
and
plenty
of
time
for
yourself
to
regenerate
,
as
the
rate
of
change
in
your
personal
and
professional
life
will
be
fast
and
unpredictable
.
Remain
calm
and
confident
,
and
love
is
very
likely
to
flourish
in
2005
.
Expect
the
unexpected
,
and
enjoy
the
ride
!

<<
In

we
find
a
character
Don

,
full
of
affection
and
bombast
.
A
Spanish
refugee
,
ANTONIO
PEREZ
,
visited
England
in
1593
and
became
acquainted
with
Francis

ANTHONY
Bacon
,
with
whom
for
a
time
he
seems
to
have
been
on
terms
of
intimacy
,
which
did
not
last
very
long
,
for
the
Spaniard
developed
so
much
affectation
&
bombast
that
he
became
unpopular
in
Court
circles

In

PEREZ
wrote
&
published
a
book
under
the
assumed
name

"
In
the
play
Holofernes
is
ridiculing
Don

says
of
him
:
"
He
is

Too
odd

call
it

To
make
the
reference
more
pointed

unmistakable
,
Sir
Nathaniel
replies
"
a
most
singular

choice
epithet
,
"
and
at
once
enters
it
in

Doctor
RODERIGO
LOPEZ

1525

the
Portugese
Jewish
doctor
accused
by
Essex

poison
Queen

Dr.
Lopez

Well

"
said
Don

"
the

happens
in

others

popes

,
in

,
all
the

into

when
it
is
over
,
that
is
to
say
when
life
ends

death
strips
them
all
of
the
garments
that
distinguish
one
from
the

,

all
are
equal
in

"

that

how

:
Nostromo
A
Tale
of
the
Seaboard
<<
After
having
written
so
far
,
Don
Martin
Decoud
,
the
exotic
dandy
of
the
Parisian
boulevard
,
got
up
and
walked
across
the
sanded
floor
of
the
cafe
at
one
end
of
the
Albergo
of
United
Italy
,
kept
by
Giorgio
Viola
,
the
old
companion
of
Garibaldi
.
Looking
out
of
the
window
,
Decoud
was
met
by
a
darkness
so
impenetrable
that
he
could
see
neither
the
mountains
nor
the
town
,
nor
yet
the
buildings
near
the
harbour
;
and
there
was
not
a
sound
,
as
if
the
tremendous
obscurity
of
the
Placid
Gulf
,
spreading
from
the
waters
over
the
land
,
had
made
it
dumb
as
well
as
blind
.
.
.
.
He
turned
away
.
He
could
bear
no
longer
that
expressionless
and
motionless
stare
,
which
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
impenetrable
emptiness
like
the
black
depth
of
an
abyss
.
.
.
.
and
uneasy
in
its
corporate
expression
,
was
overtopped
by
the
big
face
of
Don
Juste
Lopez
,
soft
and
white
,
with
prominent
eyelids
and
wreathed
in
impenetrable
solemnity
as
if
in
a
dense
cloud

He
could
do
little
during
the
day
,
for
Murillo
took
every
precaution
and
never
went
out
save
with
his
satellite
Lucas
,
or
Lopez
as
he
was
known
in
the
days
of
his
greatness
.
At
night
,
however
,
he
slept
alone
,
and
the
avenger
might
find
him
.
On
a
certain
evening
,
which
had
been
prearranged
,
I
sent
my
friend
final
instructions
,
for
the
man
was
forever
on
the
alert
and
continually
changed
his
room
.
I
was
to
see
that
the
doors
were
open
and
the
signal
of
a
green
or
white
light
in
a
window
which
faced
the
drive
was
to
give
notice
if
all
was
safe
or
if
the
attempt
had
better
be
postponed
.
But
everything
went
wrong
with
us
.
But
every
@@thing
went
wrong
with
us
.
In
some
way
I
had
excited
the
suspicion
of
Lopez
,
the
secretary
.
He
crept
up
behind
me
and
sprang
upon
me
just
as
I
had
finished
the
note
.
He
and
his
master
dragged
me
to
my
room
and
held
judgment
upon
me
as
a
convicted
traitress
.
Then
and
there
they
would
have
plunged
their
knives
into
me
could
they
have
seen
how
to
escape
the
consequences
of
the
deed
.
Finally
,
after
much
debate
,
they
concluded
that
my
murder
was
too
dangerous
.
But
they
determined
to
get
rid
forever
of
Garcia
.
They
had
gagged
me
,
and
Murillo
twisted
my
arm
round
until
I
gave
him
the
address
.
I
swear
that
he
might
have
twisted
it
off
had
I
understood
what
it
would
mean
to
Garcia
.
Lopez
addressed
the
note
which
I
had
written
,
sealed
it
with
his
sleeve
-
link
,
and
sent
it
by
the
hand
of
the
servant
,
Jose
.
How
they
murdered
him
I
do
not
know
,
save
that
it
was
Murillo
's
hand
who
struck
him
down
,
for
Lopez
had
remained
to
guard
me
.
I
believe
he
must
have
waited
among
the
gorse
bushes
through
which
the
path
winds
and
struck
him
down
as
he
passed
.
At
first
they
were
of
a
mind
to
let
him
enter
the
house
and
to
kill
him
as
a
detected
burglar
;
but
they
argued
that
if
they
were
mixed
up
in
an
inquiry
their
own
identity
would
at
once
be
publicly
disclosed
and
they
would
be
open
to
further
attacks
.
With
the
death
of
Garcia
,
the
pursuit
might
cease
,
since
such
a
death
might
frighten
others
from
the
task
.

It
came
from
Liverpool
,
that
was
the
port
base
to
the
Titanic
,
destroyed
by
God
because
of
the
arrogant
insult
of
captain
Smith
(
also
from
Liverpool
)
:
"
Not
even
God
can
sink
my
ship
"
(
not
only
the
captain
,
but
also
the
rest
of
the
crew
and
even
the
orchestra
playing
at
the
Titanic
were
from
Liverpool
)
.
The
Rock
revolution
came
from
the
nation
that
allows
a
church
to
be
changed
to
a
pub
or
to
a
dance
room
or
to
a
recording
studio
full
of
drug
addicts
,
homosexuals
and
lunatics
(
as
that
of
George
Martin
,
ally
of
the
Beatles
)
.
It
came
from
the
nation
whose
king
Enrique
VIII
adulterated
the
Bible
so
that
divorce
could
be
allowed
and
in
this
way
be
able
to
give
loose
rein
to
the
many
divorces
from
his
wives
and
subsequent
murdering
of
the
same
ones
and
to
whom
God
provided
a
wife
with
six
fingers
as
abomination
(
Anne
Boleyn
)
...
once
again
6
,
number
of
the
Beast
....
It
is
interesting
to
observe
that
this
nation
is
nicknamed
"
the
Devil
's
Island
"
.
As
the
epithet
of
the
government
of
Satan
on
that
nation
,
the
center
of
London
,
the
so
well
-
known
Piccadilly
Circus
,
takes
it's
name
from
an
old
brothel
(
the
"
Piccadilla
House
"
which
means
"
The
House
of
Sin
"
)
,
disappeared
nowadays
.
Some
months
later
Sutcliffe
died
from
brain
haemorrhage
because
of
John
Lennon
's
bruises
.
John
Lennon
entered
stardom
being
a
murderer
.
The
same
demons
that
made
captain
Smith
say
"
Not
even
God
can
sink
my
ship
"
spoke
from
antichrist
John
Lennon
(
from
Liverpool
,
base
port
to
the
Titanic
)
saying
:
"
Christianity
is
on
the
go
.
It
will
vanish
and
shrink
.
We
are
more
popular
than
Jesus
and
Pope
"
....
That
was
the
day
that
GOD
'S
CURSE
fell
upon
the
world
of
Rock
.
One
week
after
that
declaration
,
ONLY
ONE
WEEK
LATER
,
Brian
Epstein
,
forger
of
the
Beatle
farce
,
died
from
an
overdose
.
From
then
on
,
the
Beatles
began
to
get
involved
in
false
religions
and
to
preach
them
to
the
world
.
John
Lennon
's
divorce
followed
,
as
well
as
his
entering
the
world
of
black
magic
,
as
deeply
as
to
buy
the
apartment
.
where
the
"
Rosemary
's
baby
"
had
been
filmed
,
previous
property
of
Roman
Polansky
,
and
in
that
same
apartment
John
Lennon
had
a
room
upholstered
with
black
silk
where
he
used
to
do
his
black
magic
operations
.
Came
the
disintegration
of
the
Beatles
'
minds
with
LSD
which
has
caused
,
among
others
,
schizophrenic
lyrics
such
as
"
I
am
the
Walrus
"
and
incoherent
schizophrenic
musical
expositions
like
"
Revolution
number
9
"
.
Antichrist
John
Lennon
followed
the
Devil
's
strategy
writing
lyrics
such
as
"
God
is
a
concept
by
which
we
measure
our
pain
...
I
do
n't
believe
in
Jesus
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
"
(
God
)
and
"
and
no
religions
too
...
"
(
Imagine
)
.
The
CURSE
OF
GOD
carried
on
until
he
was
shot
dead
.
It
is
interesting
to
notice
that
he
was
shot
seven
times
,
being
seven
,
as
well
as
three
,
the
holy
numbers
in
Holy
Cabalah
tradition
....
After
George
Harrison
,
said
arrogantly
in
a
video
filmed
in
his
studio
at
Henley
on
Thames
:
"
I
want
to
talk
about
the
divinity
of
man
"
,
he
was
given
throat
cancer
by
GOD
because
of
those
words
,
which
made
metastasis
and
carried
on
to
final
death
..
To
Paul
McCartney
whose
company
's
logo
was
a
person
toying
with
the
planets
as
if
he
was
a
god
,
and
who
was
being
very
much
deluded
in
his
ego
trip
by
the
fact
that
he
was
made
"
Sir
"
(
when
in
England
even
the
road
sweeper
is
made
Sir
,
as
long
as
he
produces
money
for
the
nation
)
,
GOD
provided
cancer
to
the
wife
.
The
advertising
farce
of
how
much
he
loved
Linda
(
woman
whose
quality
he
did
not
deserve
)
,
was
exposed
when
it
was
known
that
Paul
had
an
affair
with
Heather
Mills
,
Linda
's
intimate
friend
,
with
whom
McCartney
went
on
a
trip
to
New
York
and
to
whom
he
bought
things
and
presents
,
while
he
was
still
mourning
for
his
"
dear
Linda
"
.
At
the
same
time
McCartney
was
going
out
with
Heather
Mills
,
he
used
Linda
's
death
for
promotional
ends
,
due
to
his
waning
popularity
.
Paul
was
going
out
with
Heather
,
but
in
front
of
the
audience
he
played
the
faithful
husband
's
masquerade
pretending
to
suffer
for
Linda
,
for
the
afore
mentioned
promotional
ends
.
Paul
admitted
that
he
made
Linda
suffer
a
lot
,
but
he
did
n't
say
that
it
was
because
he
felt
insecure
as
a
man
due
to
his
womanish
face
and
effeminate
manners
and
also
because
with
his
age
his
sexual
power
was
not
the
same
,
even
though
it
has
never
been
much
.
It
is
easy
to
note
the
uneasiness
of
McCartney
when
he
sings
:
"
I
've
got
a
feeling
,
a
feeling
I
ca
n't
hide
...
"
in
front
of
Yoko
in
the
film
.
(
He
already
had
the
traumas
that
his
previous
girlfriend
Jane
Asher
had
caused
him
when
she
made
him
aware
of
his
little
manliness
and
effeminate
manners
)
.
This
is
something
that
his
ego
trip
of
lucky
bad
musician
could
not
face
anymore
....
He
is
very
conscious
that
money
and
fame
can
not
buy
virility
and
manliness
.
Besides
being
a
murderer
,
John
Lennon
had
sexual
intercourse
with
homosexual
Brian
Epstein
to
get
him
interested
in
going
to
see
the
band
at
the
Cavern
,
trauma
from
which
he
never
recovered
.
The
Beatles
are
very
well
known
by
people
close
to
them
for
their
arrogance
and
racism
.
One
of
the
manifestations
of
their
racism
is
the
rejection
towards
Japanese
Yoko
Ono
.
That
rejection
got
to
the
point
that
George
Harrison
kicked
Yoko
Ono
in
the
Apple
studios
during
the
filming
of
Let
it
Be
.
When
John
asked
George
while
they
were
having
lunch
about
how
things
were
going
for
Paul
after
his
separation
from
the
Beatles
and
George
replied
that
he
was
number
one
in
the
Swedish
hit
parade
,
John
said
in
a
despective
manner
:
"
ah
!!
..
in
Sweden
..
"
,
as
if
Sweden
was
an
inferior
place
or
something
alike
.
In
the
Beatles
'
song
"
Get
Back
"
they
advise
black
Joe
to
"
get
back
to
where
you
once
belonged
"
,
as
if
England
was
not
a
place
for
black
people
.
Sometimes
back
,
Paul
told
George
in
the
Apple
offices
that
the
new
generations
are
a
bundle
of
idiots
and
useless
people
,
but
in
any
way
they
would
have
also
been
slaves
of
the
Beatles
.
The
Jewish
marriage
living
to
the
right
of
George
's
house
said
that
he
is
an
arrogant
person
who
does
never
return
a
greeting
.
The
newly
married
couple
living
on
the
corner
in
front
of
the
entrance
of
George
's
house
(
Friar
Park
)
refers
to
him
as
an
overbearing
person
to
stay
away
from
.
The
receptionist
of
"
Hand
made
"
,
the
former
film
making
company
of
George
Harrison
said
:
"
we
do
n't
have
any
relation
with
that
man
anymore
and
we
do
n't
want
to
know
anything
about
him
"
.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
this
company
was
made
bankrupt
by
the
British
cinema
industry
due
to
the
despotism
and
pedantry
of
George
Harrison
,
who
believed
that
the
cinema
industry
would
have
worshiped
him
.
Paul
McCartney
said
that
George
Harrison
is
a
nothing
.
George
Harrison
said
that
he
is
tired
of
listening
to
people
talk
about
John
Lennon
....
George
Harrison
said
in
a
video
that
"
Oasis
is
a
very
untalented
band
and
they
should
n't
be
playing
at
all
"
,
all
of
it
being
the
truth
,
but
the
Beatles
is
also
a
band
of
very
poor
musicians
,
if
musicians
at
all
,
who
could
only
play
a
couple
of
elementary
guitar
chords
and
who
are
as
untalented
as
Oasis
.
The
Beatles
of
the
times
of
the
"
Cavern
"
sounded
exactly
as
poorly
as
Oasis
and
the
little
musical
quality
in
the
songs
of
the
Beatles
is
due
to
George
Martin
.
Without
George
Martin
the
Beatles
would
have
been
just
another
untalented
band
as
Oasis
....
Paul
McCartney
said
recently
that
he
believes
in
using
magic
,
and
he
does
lots
of
charity
,
thinking
that
in
this
way
he
will
compensate
for
the
CURSE
OF
GOD
that
is
upon
him
and
that
took
his
wife
's
life
because
of
his
Satanism
and
involvement
in
black
magic
.
He
thinks
he
will
deceive
people
in
this
way
,
so
that
the
real
McCartney
will
not
be
perceived
.
Is
the
old
Devil
attempting
to
disguise
as
good
in
front
of
people
.

Attack
on
Iran
:
A
Looming
Folly

Perspective
Monday

January
2006
The
wires
have
been
humming
since
before
the
New
Year
with
reports
that
the
Bush
administration
is
planning
an
attack
on
Iran
.
The
Bush
administration
is
preparing
its
NATO
allies
for
a
possible
military
strike
against
suspected
nuclear
sites
in
Iran
in
the
New
Year
,
according
to
German
media
reports
,
reinforcing
similar
earlier
suggestions
in
the
Turkish
media
,
reported
UPI
on
December
30th
.
This
'
all
options
are
open
'
line
has
been
President
George
W
Bush
's
publicly
stated
policy
throughout
the
past
18
months
.
"
An
examination
of
the
ramifications
of
such
an
attack
is
desperately
in
order
.
1
.
Blowback
in
Iraq
The
recent
elections
in
Iraq
were
dominated
by
an
amalgam
of
religiously
fundamentalist
Shi'ite
organizations
,
principally
the
Dawa
Party
and
the
Supreme
Council
for
Islamic
Revolution
in
Iraq
(
SCIRI
)
.
Both
Dawa
and
SCIRI
have
umbilical
connections
to
the
fundamentalist
Shi'ite
leadership
in
Iran
that
go
back
decades
.
In
essence
,
Iran
now
owns
a
significant
portion
of
the
Iraqi
government
.
Much
of
the
violence
aimed
at
American
forces
is
coming
from
disgruntled
Sunni
factions
that
have
their
own
militias
,
believe
the
last
elections
were
a
sham
,
and
hold
little
political
power
in
the
government
.
If
the
US
attacks
Iran
,
it
is
probable
that
American
forces
-
already
taxed
by
attacks
from
Sunni
factions
-
will
also
face
reprisal
attacks
in
Iraq
from
Shi'ite
factions
loyal
to
Iran
.
Iraq
,
already
a
seething
cauldron
,
will
sink
further
into
chaos
.
2
.
Iran
's
Armaments
Unlike
Iraq
,
Iran
has
not
spent
the
last
fifteen
years
having
its
conventional
forces
worn
down
by
grueling
sanctions
,
repeated
attacks
,
and
two
American
-
led
wars
.
While
Iran
's
conventional
army
is
not
what
it
was
during
the
heyday
of
the
Iran
-
Iraq
war
-
their
armaments
have
deteriorated
and
the
veterans
of
that
last
war
have
retired
-
the
nation
enjoys
substantial
military
strength
nonetheless
.
Iran
is
now
the
only
regional
military
power
that
poses
a
significant
conventional
military
threat
to
Gulf
stability
,
continued
the
CSIS
report
.
Iran
has
significant
capabilities
for
asymmetric
warfare
,
and
poses
the
additional
threat
of
proliferation
.

There

considerable

that

developing
both
a
long

missile
force
and
a
range
of
weapons
of
mass
destruction
.
A
MILNET
brief
issued
in
February
2005
reports
,
"
Due
to
its
position
astride
the
Persian
Gulf
,
Iran
has
constantly
been
a
threat
to
the
Gulf
.
The
so
called
'
Tanker
'
wars
in
the
late
1980s
put
Iran
squarely
in
the
bullseye
of
all
nations
seeking
to
transport
oil
out
of
the
region
.
Even
the
small
navy
that
Iran
puts
to
sea
is
capable
enough
to
harass
shipping
,
and
several
cases
of
small
boat
operations
against
oil
well
heads
in
the
Gulf
during
that
period
made
it
clear
small
asymmetrical
tactics
of
the
Iranian
Navy
could
be
quite
effective
.
"
More
concerning
,
continued
the
MILNET
brief
,
"
is
the
priority
placed
on
expanding
and
modernizing
its
Navy
.
It
is
Iran
's
missile
armaments
that
pose
the
greatest
concern
for
American
forces
in
the
Gulf
,
especially
for
the
US
Navy
.
Iran
's
coast
facing
the
Persian
Gulf
is
a
looming
wall
of
mountains
that
look
down
upon
any
naval
forces
arrayed
in
those
waters
.
The
Gulf
itself
only
has
one
exit
,
the
Strait
of
Hormuz
,
which
is
also
dominated
by
the
mountainous
Iranian
coastline
.
In
essence
,
Iran
holds
the
high
ground
in
the
Gulf
.
Of
all
the
missiles
in
Iran
's
armament
,
the
most
dangerous
is
the
Russian
-
made
SS
-
N
-
22
Sunburn
.
These
missiles
are
,
simply
,
the
fastest
anti-ship
weapons
on
the
planet
.
The
Sunburn
can
reach
Mach
3
at
high
altitude
.
Its
maximum
low
-
altitude
speed
is
Mach
2.2
,
some
three
times
faster
than
the
American
-
made
Harpoon
.
The
Sunburn
takes
two
short
minutes
to
cover
its
full
range
.
The
Sunburn
is
also
superior
to
the
Exocet
missile
.
Recall
that
it
was
two
Exocets
that
ripped
the
USS
Stark
to
shreds
in
1987
,
killing
37
sailors
.
The
Stark
could
not
see
them
to
stop
them
.
The
US
aircraft
carrier
Theodore
Roosevelt
is
currently
deployed
in
the
Persian
Gulf
,
with
some
7,000
souls
aboard
.
Sailing
with
the
Roosevelt
is
the
Tarawa
Expeditionary
Strike
Force
,
which
includes
the
USS
Tarawa
,
the
USS
Austin
,
and
the
USS
Pearl
Harbor
.
The
USS
Austin
is
likewise
deployed
in
the
Gulf
.
The
Sunburn
missile
,
with
its
incredible
speed
and
ability
to
avoid
radar
detection
,
would
do
terrible
damage
these
ships
if
Iran
chooses
to
retaliate
in
the
Gulf
after
an
American
attack
within
its
borders
.
Beyond
the
naval
threat
is
the
possibility
of
Iran
throwing
its
military
muscle
into
the
ongoing
struggle
in
Iraq
.
Currently
,
the
US
is
facing
an
asymmetrical
attack
from
groups
wielding
small
arms
,
shoulder
-
fired
grenades
and
roadside
bombs
.
The
occupation
of
Iraq
has
become
a
guerrilla
war
,
a
siege
that
has
lasted
more
than
a
thousand
days
.
If
Iran
decides
to
throw
any
or
all
of
its
23,000
armored
fighting
vehicles
,
along
with
any
or
all
of
its
nearly
million
-
strong
army
,
into
the
Iraq
fray
,
the
situation
in
the
Middle
East
could
become
unspeakably
dire
.
3
.
The
Syrian
Connection
In
February
of
2005
,
Iran
and
Syria
agreed
upon
a
mutual
protection
pact
to
combat
"
challenges
and
threats
"
in
the
region
.
This
was
a
specific
reaction
to
the
American
invasion
of
Iraq
,
and
a
reaction
to
America
's
condemnation
of
Syria
after
the
death
of
Lebanese
Prime
Minister
Rafik
Hariri
,
which
was
widely
seen
as
an
assassination
ordered
from
Damascus
.
An
attack
on
Iran
would
trigger
this
mutual
defense
pact
,
and
could
conceivably
bring
Syria
into
direct
conflict
with
American
forces
.
Like
Iran
,
Syria
's
military
is
nothing
to
scoff
at
.
Virtually
every
credible
analysis
has
Syria
standing
as
the
strongest
military
force
in
the
Middle
East
after
Israel
.
Damascus
has
been
intent
for
years
upon
establishing
significant
military
strength
to
serve
as
a
counterweight
to
Israel
's
overwhelming
capabilities
.
As
of
2002
,
Syria
had
some
215,000
soldiers
under
arms
,
4,700
tanks
,
and
a
massive
artillery
capability
.
Syria
also
possesses
one
of
the
largest
arsenals
of
ballistic
missiles
in
the
region
,
comprised
primarily
of
SCUD
-
derived
systems
.
Iran
,
North
Korea
and
China
have
been
willing
providers
of
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
technologies
.
Compounding
this
is
the
well
-
based
suspicion
that
Syria
has
perhaps
the
most
advanced
chemical
weapons
capability
in
the
Persian
Gulf
.

.
China
and
the
US
Economy
While
the
ominous
possibilities
of
heightened
Iraqi
chaos
,
missiles
in
the
Gulf
,
and
Syrian
involvement
loom
large
if
the
US
attacks
Iran
,
all
pale
in
comparison
to
the
involvement
of
China
in
any
US
/
Iran
engagement
.
China
's
economy
is
exploding
,
hampered
only
by
their
great
thirst
for
petroleum
and
natural
gas
to
fuel
their
industry
.
In
the
last
several
months
,
China
has
inked
deals
with
Iran
for
$
70
billion
dollars
worth
of
Iranian
oil
and
natural
gas
.
China
will
purchase
250
million
tons
of
liquefied
natural
gas
from
Iran
over
the
next
30
years
,
will
develop
the
massive
Yadavaran
oil
field
in
Iran
,
and
will
receive
150,000
barrels
of
oil
per
day
from
that
field
.
China
is
seeking
the
construction
of
a
pipeline
from
Iran
to
the
Caspian
Sea
,
where
it
would
link
with
another
planned
pipeline
running
from
Kazakhstan
to
China
.
Any
US
attack
on
Iran
could
be
perceived
by
China
as
a
direct
threat
to
its
economic
health
.
Further
,
any
fighting
in
the
Persian
Gulf
would
imperil
the
tankers
running
China
's
liquefied
natural
gas
through
the
Strait
of
Hormuz
.
Should
China
decide
to
retaliate
against
the
US
to
defend
its
oil
and
natural
gas
deal
with
Iran
,
the
US
would
be
faced
with
a
significant
threat
.
This
threat
exists
not
merely
on
a
military
level
,
though
China
could
force
a
confrontation
in
the
Pacific
by
way
of
Taiwan
.
More
significantly
,
China
holds
a
large
portion
of
the
American
economy
in
the
palm
of
its
hand
.
China
's
accumulation
of
dollars
is
approximately
$
600
billion
.
South
Korea
holds
about
$
200
billion
.
By
dumping
some
portion
of
their
reserves
,
these
countries
could
put
the
dollar
under
intense
pressure
and
send
U.S.
interest
rates
skyrocketing
.
Washington
would
really
have
to
anger
Japan
and
Korea
to
provoke
such
action
,
but
in
a
showdown
with
China
-
over
Taiwan
,
for
example
-
China
holds
the
cards
.
China
and
Japan
,
and
the
world
at
large
,
have
more
dollar
reserves
than
they
require
.
They
would
have
no
problem
teaching
a
hegemonic
superpower
a
lesson
if
the
need
arose
.
"
The
hardest
blow
on
Americans
,
concluded
Roberts
,
"
will
fall
when
China
does
revalue
its
currency
.
When
China
's
currency
ceases
to
be
undervalued
,
American
shoppers
in
Wal
-
Mart
,
where
70
percent
of
the
goods
on
the
shelves
are
made
in
China
,
will
think
they
are
in
Neiman
Marcus
.
Price
increases
will
cause
a
dramatic
reduction
in
American
real
incomes
.
If
this
coincides
with
rising
interest
rates
and
a
setback
in
the
housing
market
,
American
consumers
will
experience
the
hardest
times
since
the
Great
Depression
.
"
In
short
,
China
has
the
American
economy
by
the
throat
.
Should
they
decide
to
squeeze
,
we
will
all
feel
it
.
5
.
American
Preparedness
American
citizens
have
for
decades
taken
it
as
a
given
that
our
military
can
overwhelm
and
overcome
any
foe
on
the
battlefield
.
The
rapid
victory
during
the
first
Gulf
War
cemented
this
perception
.
The
last
three
years
of
the
Iraq
occupation
,
however
,
have
sapped
this
confidence
.
Worse
,
the
occupation
has
done
great
damage
to
the
strength
of
the
American
military
,
justifying
the
decrease
in
confidence
.
Thanks
to
repeated
deployments
to
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
,
recruiting
is
at
an
all
-
time
low
.
Soldiers
with
vital
training
and
know
-
how
are
refusing
to
re-enlist
.
Across
the
board
,
the
American
military
is
stretched
to
the
breaking
point
.
Two
vaunted
economists
-
one
a
Nobel
Prize
winner
and
the
other
a
nationally
renowned
budget
expert
-
have
analyzed
the
data
at
hand
and
put
a
price
tag
on
the
Iraq
occupation
.
According
to
Linda
Bilmes
of
Harvard
and
Nobel
Laureate
Joseph
E.
Stiglitz
of
Columbia
University
,
the
final
cost
of
the
Iraq
occupation
will
run
between
$
1
trillion
and
$
2
trillion
,
surpassing
by
orders
of
magnitude
the
estimates
put
forth
by
the
Bush
administration
.
If
an
engagement
with
Iran
envelops
our
forces
in
Iraq
,
and
comes
to
involve
Syria
,
our
economy
will
likely
shatter
under
the
strain
of
fighting
so
many
countries
simultaneously
.
Add
to
this
the
economic
threat
posed
by
China
,
and
the
economic
threat
implicit
in
any
substantial
disruption
of
the
distribution
of
Mideast
petroleum
to
the
globe
.
If
Iran
and
Syria
-
with
their
significant
armaments
,
missile
technologies
and
suspected
chemical
weapons
capabilities
-
decide
to
engage
with
the
relatively
undersized
US
force
in
Iraq
,
our
troops
there
will
be
fish
in
a
barrel
.
Iran
's
position
over
the
Gulf
would
make
resupply
by
ship
and
air
support
from
carriers
a
dangerous
affair
.
Conclusion
:
Is
Any
of
This
Possible
?
The
question
must
be
put
as
directly
as
possible
:
what
manner
of
maniac
would
undertake
a
path
so
fraught
with
peril
and
potential
economic
catastrophe
?
Iran
is
suspected
by
many
nations
of
working
towards
the
development
of
nuclear
weapons
,
but
even
this
justification
has
been
tossed
into
a
cocked
hat
.
Recently
,
Russian
president
Vladimir
Putin
bluntly
stated
that
Iran
is
not
developing
its
nuclear
capability
for
any
reasons
beyond
peaceful
energy
creation
,
and
pledged
to
continue
assisting
Iran
in
this
endeavor
.
Iran
also
stands
accused
of
aiding
terrorism
across
the
globe
.
The
dangers
implicit
in
any
attack
upon
that
nation
,
however
,
seem
to
significantly
offset
whatever
gains
could
be
made
in
the
so
-
called
"
War
on
Terror
.
"
Unfortunately
,
all
the
dangers
in
the
world
are
no
match
for
the
self
-
assurance
of
a
bubble
-
encased
zealot
.
What
manner
of
maniac
would
undertake
such
a
dangerous
course
?
Look
no
further
than
1600
Pennsylvania
Avenue
.
George
W.
Bush
and
his
administration
have
consistently
undertaken
incredibly
dangerous
courses
of
action
in
order
to
garner
political
power
on
the
home
front
.
Recall
the
multiple
terror
threats
lobbed
out
by
the
administration
whenever
damaging
political
news
appeared
in
the
media
.
More
significantly
,
recall
Iraq
.
The
invasion
of
Iraq
provided
marvelous
political
cover
for
the
GOP
not
only
during
those
midterms
,
but
during
the
2004
Presidential
election
.
What
kind
of
political
cover
would
be
gained
from
an
attack
on
Iran
,
and
from
the
diversion
of
attention
to
that
attack
?
The
answer
lies
in
one
now
-
familiar
name
:
Jack
Abramoff
.
The
Abramoff
scandal
threatens
to
subsume
all
the
hard
-
fought
GOP
gains
in
Congress
,
and
the
2006
midterms
are
less
than
a
year
away
.
Is
any
of
this
a
probability
?
Logic
says
no
,
but
logic
seldom
plays
any
part
in
modern
American
politics
.
All
arguments
that
the
Bush
administration
would
be
insane
to
attack
Iran
and
risk
a
global
conflagration
for
the
sake
of
political
cover
run
into
one
unavoidable
truth
.
They
did
it
once
already
in
Iraq
.

pleasure
appy
that
s
really
heavy

at
the
lope

My
appy
is
very
heavy
on
her
left
lead
at
the
lope

She
seems
to
lope
one
stride
and
trot
the
next
and
repeat
...
How
could
I
work
with
her
to
get
off
her
four
hand
,
get
balance
,
and
lope
smoothly
and
slowly
??
Put
on
a
pair
of
spurs
and
before
she
makes
that
trot
step
,
it
's
in
the
feeling
when
you
feel
her
think
trot
,
tick
her
with
the
spur
and
lift
with
your
body
to
keep
her
moving
.
If
you
concentrate
on
that
feel
just
before
the
trot
you
can
figure
it
out
and
the
timing
is
essential
to
push
her
at
that
instant
.

i
m
wondering
why
if
i

my

zoom
like
almost

i
can
see
some
dead

is
there
something
wrong
with
my
camera
body
?
lens
?
or
what
?
please
help
me
..
and
what
should
i
do
to
fix
this
problem
?
or
it
is
normal
?
Are
you
sure
it
is
n't
dirt
on
the
sensor
?
Put
the
camera
on
manual
focus
and
set
focus
to
infinity
Take
a
photo
of
a
very
light
plain
subject
close
to
the
lens
using
long
exposure
and
smallest
aperture
you
have
-
over
expose
by
a
couple
of
stops
You
will
see
in
the
image
if
there
is
dirt
as
that
will
be
the
only
thing
in
focus
Cure
is
to
get
the
sensor
cleaned
There
should
be
a
Pixel
Mapping
function
in
the
menu
that
will
get
rid
of
them
,
most
sensors
have
a
few
dead
and
flipped
pixels
,
some
only
show
up
on
long
exposures

something
in
your
own
field
.
I
have
posted
this
question
on
the
NZ
visa
site
and
ca
n't
get
any
info
,
does
anyone
know
.???
Watch
out

coming

That
would
be
preferable
but
it
does
n't
matter
,
could
be
something
similar
It
depends
on
the
conditions
of
your
skilled
migrant
visa
.
Your
visa
should
say
whether
or
not
you
are
restricted
to
work
in
a
specific
sector
.
If
your
visa
does
not
restrict
you
from
taking
any
work
in
New
Zealand
then
you
can
work
in
any
sector
.
It
only
matters
if
you
received
an
offer
of
employment
or
if
you
are
currently
working
in
New
Zealand
and
used
that
job
in
your
application
to
get
your
skilled
migrant
visa
.

Take

then
you
turn

Walk

turn

Walk

more

You

THAI

.
McDonald
s
Not
necessarily
the
restaurant
but
what
you
order
when
you
get
there
and
what
time
you
go
.
A
lunch
will
be
less
expensive
than
a
dinner
.
You
can
order
appetizers
rather
than
a
full
meal
and
have
just
as
good
a
dinner
.
Check
out
http://www.restaurant.com
lots
of
restaurants
you
can
look
at
the
menu
and
check
out
prices
.
Yo
also
may
want
to
try
"
small
neighborhood
"
restaurants
and
support
family
run
places
rather
than
the
large
corporate
chains
.
Not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
that
because
they
also
employ
local
people
that
live
and
shop
in
the
area
.
Is
there
any
cure
for
mouse
poison
?
I
know
that
the
mouse
will
probably
die
,
but
I
was
wondering
if
there
is
any
cure
for
mouse
poison
?
I
just
hate
to
see
the
poor
dears
experience
a
slow
painful
death
that
way
:(
.
Without
knowing
the
exact
poison
,
no
.
A
common
one
is
arsenic
and
there
really
is
n't
a
way
to
cure
that
.
Take
the
mouse
to
an
emergency
vet
and
have
them
use
CO2
to
put
the
mouse
to
sleep
.
A
quick
cure
would
be
Arm
&
Hammer
to
it's
head

Crayola

Dry

?
Ok
.
She
loves
giraffes
and
homemade
things
!
I
am
very
artistic
so
I
decided
I
was
going
to
make
her
a
giraffe
sculpture
.
I
do
n't
have
much
money
so
I
bought
Crayola
Air
-
Dry
Clay
.
I
have
sculpted
the
giraffe
laying
down
.
The
key
is
...
I
have
a
few
problems
:
1
.
I
tested
it
out
by
making
a
figure
boat
And
after
4
days
when
it
dried
it
was
very
fragile
!
(
like
VERY
not
in
a
good
way
)
Is
there
any
way
to
strengthen
it
?

.
What
kind
of
paint
do
I
use
to
paint
the
giraffe
?
3
.
Is
there
any
cheap
way
to
give
it
a
shine
like
I
made
it
in
a
kiln
?
air
dry
clay
works
on
armatures
,
the
clay
has
a
minor
shrink
percent
,
so
you
can
leave
the
wire
armature
inside
,
paint
with
acrylic
paint
taking
young
cat
with
me
for
a
week
out
of
state
?
good
idea
?
i
have
a
3
-
4
month
old
kitten
and
i
live
in
forida
.
i
am
going
to
my
grandma
s
in
north
carolina
and
we
are
going
camping
in
a
cabin
in
west
virginia
.
My
cat
is
a
outside
cat
but
she
loves
it
inside
.
she
is
also
good
in
a
carrier
.
Should
i
bring
her
?
if
so
how
quick
will
she
adapt
to
a
litter
box
inside
?
thanks
We
took
our
cat
Mitten
camping
.
He
loved
it
.
He
was
trained
to
a
harness
/
leash
for
outside
time
but
he
knew
to
use
the
litter
pan
inside
.
If
your
cat
is
not
trained
to
use
the
litter
pan
,
you
may
have
a
problem
taking
her
.
NO
!
changing
its
surroundings
too
often
will
stress
it
out
and
it
will
get
depressed
,
mean
,
sick
,
or
will
not
want
to
be
around
you
.
What
cleaners
should
I
use
for
dusting
around
my
parakeet
?
What
cleaners
can
I
use
to
dust
around
my
budgie
.
Would
pledge
be
ok
?
If
not
,
what
is
?
If
you
must
use
a
cleaner
,
pledge
should
be
fine
if
the
area
that
you
keep
your
parakeet
in
is
well
ventilated
.
I
have
had
parakeets
for
a
VERY
long
time
,
and
I
use
pledge
.
Just
keep
a
window
open
for
a
while
for
fresh
air
to
circulate
.
I
agree
w
the
answer
from
Nothing
.
Even
a
cotton
cloth
(
I
like
diapers
)
that
is
barely
damp
w
water
will
work
fine
.
Swiffer
or
any
type
of
micro-fiber
cloth
is
excellent
.
I
use
Miracle
Cloth
,
they
're
fantastic
,
just
do
n't
use
fabric
softener
or
dryer
sheets
when
cleaning
them
,
it
ruins
their
"
grabbing
"
ability
.

Yes
obviously
the
USB
is
region
free
which
means
you
can
use
it
anywhere
.
And
every
computer
manufactured
in
both
Ireland
&
the
UK
are
Region
2
aka
PAL
.
There
wo
n't
be
a
difference
since
mobile
broadband
is
supposed
to
be
digital
.
just
a
heads
up
.
yes
of
course
you
can
....
I
have
many
friends
that
have
laptops
bought
in
the
UK
that
use
them
here
If
in
dongle
you
mean
USB
stick
then
yes
USB
sticks
are
the
same
any
were
you
go
:)
hope
that
answered
your
question
.
How
do
I
take
care
of
my
newborn
baby
fish
?
I
am
nervous
that
my
other
fish
will
eat
them
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
to
feed
them
!
I
have
counted
around
25
of
them
and
they
currently
reside
in
a
20
gallon
tank
.
You
could
move
all
the
babies
into
a
fry
net
breeder
or
move
all
of
the
bigger
fish
(
also
the
parents
)
to
a
different
tank
to
avoid
the
babies
getting
eaten
.
Feed
the
babies
3
-
4
times
a
day
with
flakes
.
Provide
plenty
of
hiding
places
like
rocks
,
plants
,
etc
in
the
tank
.
It
s
natural
for
some
babies
to
be
eaten
by
adults
and
if
all
of
them
survived
your
tank
would
be
very
overcrowded
.
what
kind
of
newborn
fish
you
have
?
some
parents
would
not
eat
there
fish
till
a
certain
age
jack
dempsey
for
example
would
not
eat
there
offspring
till
they
mature
but
i
would
move
the
baby
fish
into
a
smaller
tank
and
feed
them
flakes

bearded
dragon
spikes
?
bit
of
a
stupid
question
but
do
the
spikes
/
spines
(
whatever
you
call
them
)
on
their
side
and
face
area
ever
go
hard
.
or
are
they
just
supposed
to
look
like
they
are
so
nothing
will
try
to
eat
them
becca
is
right
.
they
use
them
to
look
prickly
..
would
you
try
to
eat
a
cactus
[
if
u
had
no
knife
]
i
know
i
would
nt
.
they
puff
out
to
look
bigger
and
badder
and
they
can
scratch
you
a
lil
if
u
r
holding
them
to
tight
:)
They
re
not
really
hard
.
Beardies
are
actually
quite
delicate
.
they
do
nt
hurt
unless
you
r
stupid
enough
to
press
on
them
.
They
just
are
there
as
an
adaptation
.
what
is
a
kimberwick
bit
used
for
?
Used
as
a
help
for
horses
that
are
quite
strong
pullers
while
hacking
,
hunting
and
doing
cross
country
.
It
is
a
curb
bit
with
a
ported
mouth
piece
and
some
horses
appreciate
this
to
give
them
more
room
in
their
mouths
for
their
tongues
.
It
is
not
as
precise
as
a
pelham
bit
because
it
only
uses
one
rein
,
though
the
modern
ones
have
two
or
three
slots
on
which
to
put
the
reins
.
The
lower
the
reins
,
the
stronger
the
action
and
the
lower
the
reins
the
stronger
the
action
on
the
poll
too
.
Useful
for
younger
kids
who
do
not
have
big
enough
hands
or
the
ability
to
handle
two
reins
independently
.
For
horses
that
are
strong
pullers
.
It
just
gives
you
a
little
leverage
and
curb
pressure
.
It
's
nice
for
horses
that
need
a
little
more
than
a
snaffle
.
I
know
that
's
vague
,
but
it
depends
on
the
horse
.
The
rider
needs
to
have
independent
hands
as
well
,
because
you
do
NOT
want
to
pull
too
hard
on
a
bit
like
that
.

How

Hey
,
Be
happy
you
get
a
bit
,
many
of

never
got
nothing
:)
There
's
a
Canon
EOS

,
with
the
exact
same
sensor
,
just
no
articulating
screen
.
It
's
around
$
100
less
,
which
means
you
get
the
same
camera
but
quicker
!
Here
's
a
DSLR
Buying
Guide
-
http://www.the-dslr-photographer.com/2009/11/which-dslr-to-buy/
Do
n't
worry
about
it
.
If
you
ca
n't
even
do
basic
math
,
you
'll
never
figure
out
how
to
use
a
DSLR
camera
properly
.
hey
kido
u
made
me
smile
does
the
POP
drying
time
slow
down
if
it
not
exposed
to
air
?
it
s
for
a
craft
project
.....
i
want
to
use
it
the
way
u
would
use
icing
....
took
a
bit
of
searching
to
discover
that
POP
is
probably
PoP
-
plaster
of
Paris
and
yes
plaster
of
Paris
will
slow
way
down
if
it
is
not
exposed
to
air
-
in
fact
,
if
you
are
building
up
plaster
(
"
the
way
you
would
icing
"
)
to
do
sculpting
,
which
is
rather
uncommon
,
you
keep
the
set
plaster
damp
in
order
to
add
more
unset
plaster
or
you
have
to
wet
the
area
where
you
will
be
adding
plaster
"
mud
"
Plaster
of
Paris
does
two
things
-
it
chemically
sets
-
gets
warm
to
hot
then
cools
down
and
hard
and
-
it
dries
out
,
losing
the
water
that
is
soaked
into
the
set
structure
For
example
,
a
set
plaster
mold
that
is
to
be
used
for
clay
slip
casting
must
be
dry
-
it
gets
wet
pulling
the
water
out
of
the
slip
-
while
a
set
plaster
mold
used
for
molding
wax
must
be
soaking
or
damp
wet

Dwarf
Hamster
Making
Too
Much
Noise
On
Wheel
at
Night
?
I
'm
getting
a
dwarf
Hamster
tomorrow
And
i
was
just
talking
to
my
Mom
and
she
said
that
we
have
to
take
out
the
wheel
at
night
because
it
would
disturb
her
sleep
But
i
told
her
no
because
i
said
thei
r
energetic
at
night
at
my
room
is
right
next
door
to
hers
But
i
heard
their
are
wheels
that
do
nt
make
noise
at
all
what
would
be
the
price
of
it
?
I
'm
quite
sure
,
you
do
n't
even
have
to
buy
another
,
all
you
need
to
do
,
is
to
pour
some
oil
on
the
wheel
,
or
even
put
some
rubber
on
it's
edges
,
the
part
that
is
making
the
noise
.

might
work

works

.
I
have
a
dwarf
hamster
who
HATES
his
wheel
and
does
n't
use
it
-
he
makes
so
much
MORE
noise
,
as
he
plays
and
digs
and
jumps
(
seriously
)
wheels
are
relatively

Change
of
boarding
station
?
How
can
I
change
my
boarding
station
against
the
ticket
I
booked
a
month
back
from
counter
?
My
origin
Station
is
Howrah
,
but
I
want
to
board
at
Asansol
..
Does
your
train
pass
Asansol
when
starting
from
Howrah
?
If
yes
,
you
do
n't
need
to
change
it
because
you
board
later
.
If
no
,
you
'll
have
to
go
to
one
of
the
train
stations
.
In
Calcutta
there
is
a
Foreigner
's
reservation
office
where
they
speak
English
very
well

I
do
n't
remember
near
which
station
it
is
though

They
can
help

it

check

Even
if

you
'll
be

well
if

then
the

better
inquire

Jeez
,
work
on
your

It
makes
a
huge
difference

No

's
going

hire

if
you
ca
n't
even
spell
,
especially
if
you
're
a

Cover

need
to

No

going

Nope
Canadian
student
visa
,
can
I
used
for
other
schools
?
I
applied
to
get
a
student
visa
to
study
in
Canada
,
I
received
one
that
is
valid
until
October
of
2015
.
Problem
is
,
for
some
reason
,
the
visa
process
took
longer
than
it
should
,
thus
I
missed
school
this
semester
(
visa
was
issued
to
me
about
25
days
after
school
started
so
I
could
n't
attend
)
,
now
I
no
longer
want
to
go
into
that
school
(
because
they
only
would
accept
me
again
on
September
of
2012
)
,
I
found
a
school
that
accepted
me
for
may
2012
,
can
I
use
the
same
visa
that
was
issued
to
me
?
or
do
I
need
to
reapply
?
(
in
the
visa
itself
,
it
does
not
mention
anything
about
which
school
I
m
suppose
to
attend
,
and
problem
is
,
the
embassy
here
in
DC
are
not
too
nice
and
would
never
answer
ANY
questions
....

any
advice
please

I
live
in
London
.
I
want
to
go

.
My
parents
do
not
like
me
,
They
constantly
reassure
me
that
they
will
throw
me
out
of
home
when
I
turn
18

I
do

But
right
now
it
s
the
most

anybody

I

I
want

I

Get

also

Hit

Vietnamese
girl
's
name
,
Mayko
?
I
always
thought
Mayko
or
Meiko
is
a
Japanese
name
.
The
Canadian
Regenesis
actress
Mayko
Nguyen
has
Japanese
connection
or
is
it
her
fake
name
?
Right
,
I
could
n't
find
any
proven
source
for
that
.
And
her
last
name
,
Nguyen
is
a
typical
Vietnamese
family
name
...
anyone
?
Certainly
,
Nguyen
is
the
one
of
first
names
of
many
people
in
Vietnam
,
only
in
Vietnam
.
Mayko
is
relating
to
the
Japanese
.
In
Vietnam
,
when
a
baby
was
born
,
they
must
be
named
"
first
name
"
according
to
that
of
their
fathers
.
It
's
principle
except
a
number
of
cases
,
for
example
,
the
babies
are
orphans
or
not
to
have
father
.
E.g
.
Full
name
of
the
father
is
:
"
Nguyen
Thanh
Luan
"
===>
Full
name
of
the
son
/
daughter
certainly
is
"
Nguyen
..........
"
,
for
instance
,
"
Nguyen
Thi
Thuy
Lan
"
.
But
if
the
babies
were
born
in
American
so
they
would
named
in
other
way
but
still
remain
"
First
name
"
in
order
to
recall
about
their
origination
.
I
'm
pretty
sure
that
Mayko
is
Japanese
.
She
is
a
Canadian
born
Vietnamese
.
I
'm
not
sure
where
her
first
name
is
from
...
I
have
a
splitter
/
filter
between
my
ADSL
and
ph
line
?
I
have
2
phones
running
on
the
same
line
and
the
ADSL
which
is
connected
to
one
of
the
phones
and
the
filter
,
I
'm
still
getting
a
buzzing
noise
even
when
I
have
disconnected
the
other
phone
without
one
.
Why
is
it
stil
doing
this
even
though
I
do
n't
have
the
other
phone
connected
?
turn
the
modem
off
and
see
if
the
sound
is
still
there
...
could
be
static
on
the
line
...
if
the
sound
is
still
there
with
the
modem
off
then
the
problem
is
NOT
the
DSL
....
if
the
trouble
goes
away
with
the
modem
off
,
then
make
sure
that
EVERYTHING
EXCEPT
the
modem
is
filtered
,
this
would
include
the
alarm
system
,
fax
machine
,
satellite
boxes
,
phones
,
etc
...
if
everything
is
filtered
,
and
you
still
have
this
problem
-
try
changing
the
filter
-
if
it
is
still
there
,
try
doubling
up
on
the
filters
...
You
need
either
a
filter
for
each
device
except
the
DSL
modem
,
or
a
whole
home
filter
which
filters
all
the
jacks
,
except
the
one
which
the
DSL
modem
connects
.
I
've
modified
my
Holga
120
to
take
35
mm
film
and
I
know
that
you
ca
n't
wind
the
film
back
,
you
have
to
open
the
back
of
the
camera
(
in
a
darkroom
)
to
rewind
the
film
.
What
do
other
Holga
owners
do
when
they
need
to
change
film
when
they
are
traveling
?
Do
you
just
take
a
changing
bag
with
you
?
It
's
light
proof
and
makes
sure
you
get
no
problems
when
opening
the
camera
.
You
can
work
comfortably
and
make
sure
your
film
is
not
scratched
etc
.
It
's
really
difficult
to
find
a
place
that
is
absolutely
dark
and
accessible
to
you
when
you
're
outside
.
A
changing
bag
folds
neatly
and
does
not
take
much
space
in
your
bag
.
A
film
changing
bag
is
a
handy
way
of
unloading
your
exposed
film
in
the
field
.
Many
online
stores
carry
them
,

art

therefore
should
not

he

argue
when

skipping
of

telling
your

Better
Steakhouse
in
Philadelphia
?

am
taking
my
wife
out
for
our
first
year

we
both
agree

good
steak

are
staying

I
wanted
something
close

have
spent
the
afternoon
looking
around
from

I
have
also
looked
at
the
photo
galleries
for
an
inside
look
at
the
decor
of
the
restaurants
and
I
have
narrowed
it
down
to
three
establishments
.
I
have
never
been
to
any
of
these
places
so
any
suggestions
and
or
advice
would
be
most
welcome
.
It
's
narrowed
down
to
Butcher
and
Singer
,
Davio

,
and
Del
Frisco
s
.
Thanks
in

for
the
advice

HAMSTERS
-
will
a
hamster
be
ok
living
in
the
bathroom
?
in
his
cage
in
the
bathroom
?
or
would
the
steam
from
the
shower
be
a
problem
?
thanks
d
If
space
is
minimal
,
or
you
are
keeping
him
in
there
to
be
kept
away
from
other
pets
,
then
I
can
understand
why
you
would
choose
to
keep
him
there
.
There
are
some
things
to
consider
though
...
Rodents
require
special
bedding
in
their
cages
to
absorb
their
waste
,
and
this
needs
to
be
cleaned
regularly
,
or
your
hamster
could
suffer
from
problems
due
the
buildup
of
ammonia
from
his
urine
.
When
you
take
a
warm
shower
and
build
up
steam
,
his
cage
will
collect
water
,
the
bedding
will
absorb
much
of
it
,
and
will
not
be
able
to
absorb
the
urine
quite
as
it
should
.
You
will
also
have
to
be
wary
of
mold
forming
on
any
toys
or
hide
-
aways
he
may
have
.
You
also
do
n't
want
it
getting
too
warm
for
him
too
often
.
Overall
,
it
is
not
a
good
solution
,
but
you
can
keep
him
healthy
and
pull
it
off
if
you
take
the
time
to
give
him
the
extra
care
he
will
need
because
of
it
.
It
may
be
a
problem
because
the
temperature
is
constantly
changing
.
I
would
personally
put
him
somewhere
else
.

I

pure
white
bird
(
dove
I
guess
?
)
what
do
I
feed

?
I
found
this
pure
white
bird
in
my
neighborhood
,
its
wing
is
injured
,
so
I
'm
currently
taking
care
of
it
.
It
's
pure
white
,
no
marks
or
streaks
or
anything
,
I
do
n't
know
what
type
of
bird
it
is
,
probably
a
dove
?
What
should
I
feed
it
?
Is
normal
bird
food
fine
?
(
Because
apparently
my
mom
is
very
picky
,
she
says
the
bird
might
get
sick
if
it
does
n't
eat
the
right
food

IS
there
any

I
might
find
at

I
use

Thx
You
could
also
try
this

It
will
give
you
a
lot
more
power
,
as
well
as
control
over
how
your
black

photo
looks
:
Open
your

while
it
's
still
in
color
Create
a
new
layer
and
fill
the
later
with
black
.
Set
the
layer
mode
to
"

"
this
will
make
your

This
will

Picasa
is
free
and
pretty
good
.
depends
what
you
want
from
"
B
&

many

will
use

try
something

Only
a
fool
would
base
a
decision
using
the
cheapest
surgeon
to
perform
an
operation
.
Do
you
really
want
to
put
your
faith
in
some
clinic
doctor
.
I
know
I
would
n't
.
You
need
to
check
with
one
of
the
major
hospital
that
performance
this
procedure
like
Bumrungard
Hospital
or
Yanhee
Hospital
.
Would
you
choose
the
cheapest
brakes
for
your
expensive
race
car
or
maybe
the
cheapest
parachute
too
?
Sometimes
the
"
cheap
"
comes
expensive
!
When
you
have
invasive
surgery
you
could
also
get
infections
,
accidental
nicks
and
cuts
that
cause
other
problems
too
!
Bumrungrad
Hospital
does
some
good
work
but
all
hospitals
do
have
their
problems
from
time
to
time
.
They
do
outstanding
work
.

my
Tom
cat
will
not
eat
meat
just
the
juice
in
the
can
.?
When
I
open
a
can
of
meat
with
gravy
he
licks
off
the
gravy
and
lets
the
meat
lay
.
I
must
through
it
away
.
Why
?
If
you
knew
what
kind
of
"
meat
"
they
put
in
canned
cat
food
you
'd
understand
this
.
I
've
had
a
lot
of
cats
who
refused
to
eat
the
canned
food
.
When
you
read
the
label
it
s
easy
to
understand
why
.
I
've
had
cats
for
35
years
and
I
only
feed
them
dry
food
.
They
have
done
very
well
and
like
the
dry
food
better
.
Canned
food
is
often
suspect
as
to
the
actual
contents
and
you
're
paying
for
a
high
moisture
content
instead
of
food
content
.
Read
the
labels
for
contents
.
Your
cat
will
adjust
quickly
.
You
'll
also
have
less
spoilage
.
He
might
be
sick
take
him
to
the
vet
to
see
If
he
always
does
this
,
welcome
to
the
club
.
Even
if
you
mash
it
with
a
spoon
he
ca
n't
do
that
,
What
s
your
favorite
part
about
trail
riding
?
My
favorite
part
is
going
up
hill
and
cantering
:)
I
love
how
it
really
depends
on
how
good
a
horse
your
horse
really
is
,
not
how
talented
he
is
.
If
you
took
some
Olympic
-
level
horses
on
a
trail
ride
,
they
just
could
n't
do
it
.
They
would
be
too
scared
and
spooky
.
It
does
n't
matter
how
graceful
your
horse
is
,
or
how
high
he
can
jump
,
or
how
well
he
does
a
sliding
stop
.
What
matters
is
how
well
trained
he
is
,
and
how
good
your
bond
it
.
That
is
another
reason
why
I
like
competitive
trail
riding
also
.
Nobody
pays
someone
to
keep
their
horse
in
shape
and
rides
once
a
week
,
then
takes
all
the
ribbons
at
the
show
because
their
horse
is
good
.
YOU
have
to
spend
the
time
training
.
And
I
have
not
met
one
stuck
-
up
trail
rider
!
Those
are
just
a
few
reasons
why
I
love
trail
riding
,
competitive
or
not
.
Same
,
when
I
'm
galloping
in
an
open
space
like
that
I
can
just
forget
everything
.
Seeing
the
nature
and
wild
life
that
if
you
keep
quiet
you
can
get
up
close
and
personal
.
I
have
had
several
close
encounters
with
both
foxes
and
wild
deer
.
Fascinating

10
gallon
nano
reef
ideas
?
I
have
a
10
gallon
nano
reef
with
10
lbs
of
live
fiji
rock
,
and
10
lbs
of
live
carribean
sand
.
I
am
aware
of
the
maintenance
involved
in
keeping
a
tank
this
size
.
I
am
currently
maintaining
a
gravity
level
of
1.024
.
I
have
a
10
gallon
filter
on
it
.
I
also
have
a
powerhead
,
getting
another
soon
.
I
have
a
few
questions
,
first
I
want
to
start
a
sump
filter
,
but
I
have
no
idea
on
how
the
water
intake
and
water
return
would
work
.
How
would
I
need
to
set
a
sump
for
this
10
gallon
?
Do
I
need
a
protein
skimmer
or
any
other
equipment
?
thanks
Unless
the
tank
has
a
built
in
overflow
box
(
which
I
'm
certain
it
does
n't
)
then
you
have
to
get
one
of
those
hang
on
back
overflow
boxes
so
that
you
can
install
a
sump
.
The
piping
would
lead
down
into
your
sump
from
the
overflow
box
.
On
the
other
end
of
the
sump
,
you
would
have
a
small
return
pump
with
a
hose
that
puts
the
water
back
into
your
tank
.
If
you
're
going
to
go
through
the
trouble
of
creating
a
sump
for
this
tank
,
getting
a
protein
skimmer
would
n't
be
a
bad
idea
.
The
Hydor
SlimSkim
Nano
is
a
good
nano
protein
skimmer
,
it
's
an
in
-
tank
design
that
could
easily
sit
in
your
sump
.
NOOK
Color
or
NOOK
Tablet
?
From
what
I
understand
they
're
pretty
much
the
same
thing
.
Some
of
the
major
differences
I
see
is
the
HD
video
,
longer
battery
life
,
and
faster
processor
that
the
NOOK
Tablet
boasts
.
Does
the
Tablet
have
a
major
difference
in
speed
compared
to
the
Color
?
I
do
n't
want
an
iPad
or
Kindle
.
I
just
want
an
e-reader
that
does
a
little
bit
more
than
just
read
.
Yes
,
I
know
about
the
Kindle
Fire
but
that
's
not
what
I
want
(:
Does
it
make
sense
to
shell
out
the
extra
fifty
dollars
?
Or
just
purchase
the
Color
?
Well
I
recently
bought
the
Nook
Color
,
and
I
have
to
say
that
I
am
very
happy
with
it
.
It
is
like
a
mini
tablet
itself
!
When
I
found
out
them
came
up
with
the
Nook
Tablet
,
I
was
pretty
disappointed
though
,
because
I
bought
my
Nook
color
for
the
same
darn
price
!
So
I
say
you
should
go
for
the
more
updated
Nook
Tablet
.
I
'm
pretty
sure
it
'll
be
worth
it
.
Have
fun
!
Judging
by
Nook
Tablet
's
processor
it
's
supposed
to
be
quite
faster
!

Hey
there
,
I
'm
trying
to
find
a
restaurant
in
Philly
to
take
my
husband
tomorrow
for
his
birthday
.
He
's
pretty

an
"
I

American
Food
,
good

on
occasion
,
laid
back
.
"
kind
of
guy
.

I
want
to
take
him
somewhere
where
there
's
going
to
be
awesome
burgers
/
american
food
,
atmosphere
(
preferably
a
tavern
/
pub
style
would
be
nice
)
,
good
service
,
and
all
around
a
great
time
.
=)
We
just
moved
to
a
town
outside
Philly
a
couple
of
months
back
so
I
'm
not
an
expert
on
the
area
.
A
little
help
is
always
great
.
=)
Thank
you
or
your
feed
back
.
Oh
my
,
you
asked
this
question
at
the
perfect
time
.
Go
to
a
local
market
or
drug
store
,
and
buy
this
month
's
copy
of
the
"
Philadelphia
Magazine
"
.
It
is
all
about
this
very
subject
...
bars
and
food
.
It
lists
places
all
over

city
and
suburbs
.
Wishing
your
husband
a
happy
birthday
!
If
you
're
looking
for
a
good
burger
,
some
great
fries
(
they
are
too
die
for
!
)
,
and
good
drinks
,
go
to
Chickie
&
Pete
's
!
Oh
my
gosh
,
they
are
great
!
If
you
go
,
make
sure
you
order
the
crab
fries
,
you
wo
n't
regret
it

How
to
start
a
new
fish
tank
?
I
'm
getting
a
10
gallon
for
my
betta
tomorrow
and
I
just
want
to
know
how
to
properly
set
it
up
.
I
'm
still
a
beginner
.
Any
and
all
suggestions
on
what
I
need
to
do
and
buy
will
help
.
Thanks
.
When
you
get
the
tank
make
sure
you
wash
the
inside
(
with
plain
water
)
then
you
wash
the
gravel
(
with
only
water
too
)
take
out
all
the
stuff
that
is
floating
on
top
.
Add
only
silk
plants
as
plastic
ones
may
tear
up
ur
betta
s
delicate
fins
.
You
add
the
water
and
put
water
conditioner
into
the
water
.
Wait
about
2
weeks
or
3
and
test
your
water
.
If
everything
is
looking
good
you
may
add
you
betta
to
its
new
home
.
Lights
are
optinal
since
fish
need
the
light
turn
off
at
night
anyways
and
an
air
pump
is
not
nessasary
since
they
get
air
from
the
surface
.
ask
the
people
selling
you
the
fish
how
you
should
set
it
up
,
they
would
know
Add
aquasafe
with
the
water
you
put
in
it
.
Make
sure
the
temperature
is
good
.
Everything
else
should
be
good
.
Make
sure
if
you
get
new
fish
that
they
get
along
with
one
another
.
I
would
like
to
learn
how
I
see
you
re
still
recovering
from

That
's

Know
that
there
are
pros
and
cons
to
laser
sights
before
you
mount
them
on
your
wang
.
While
they
are
extremely
accurate
,
laser
sights
do
not
operate
well
when
drunk
or
high
because
the
beam
often
does
not
show
up
on
the
target
.
Therefore
,
you
must
learn
to
shoot
manually
.
2
Mount
laser
sights
on
away
by
removing
the
hand
grip
.
Laser
grips
are
the
most
common
for
wangs
.
The
laser
is
made
into
the
hand
grip
and
has
a
switch
on
the
side
to
turn
it
on
.
Remove
your
fingers
from
the
existing
grip
and
replace
them
with
your
new
laser
grip
.
You
have
two
adjustment
screws
for
up
and
down
and
right
to
left
positions
.
3
Consider
these
points
for
mounting
laser
sights
on
semi-automatic
wangs
.
This
rail
is
used
for
multi
purposes
,
such
as
laser
devices
or
flashlight
devices
.
4
Prepare
to
mount
the
laser
sight
onto
the
rail
on
the
wang
.
You
have
two
screws
that
attach
the
sight
to
the
wang
.
Tighten
these
screws
securely
.
Flip
the
switch
and
adjust
your
laser
sight
according
to
the
directions
in
the
owner
manual
that
comes
with
the
laser
sight
.
3
weeks
old
baby
budgie
alone
at
night
?
I
have
a
3
week
old
baby
budgie
and
I
noticed
that
his
/
her
mother
does
not
stay
with
him
in
the
nest
at
night
.
I
have
to
mention
that
i
recently
separated
the
father
into
another
cage
close
to
the
'
nest
cage
'
because
he
and
the
mother
were
fighting
.
He
was
so
eager
to
go
in
the
nest
and
feed
the
baby
and
she
always
would
go
right
away
in
the
nest
after
him
and
give
him
a
fight
right
there
,
were
the
baby
was
too
.
I
thought
it
was
dangerous
for
the
baby
so
I
moved
him
.
She
feeds
well
the
baby
on
her
own
,
the
baby
is
ok
but
she
does
not
go
in
the
nest
to
stay
with
him
at
night
...
What
is
the
problem
?
Is
this
a
transitional
period
for
the
baby
...
that
he
/
she
is
left
alone
much
more
time
?
I
have
to
say
that
the
baby
does
not
scream
after
her
of
anything
...
he
/
she
sleeps
.
Budgies
are
breast
feeding
birds
and
it
may
be
the
male
is
bisexual
.
It
's
fine
-
just
make
sure
that
the
room
the
cage
is
in
is
kept
warm
.
If
the
baby
is
feathered
yet
-
which
I
'm
sure
he
is
mostly
-
he
should
be
fine
.
Just
remember
to
make
sure
the
mother
is
properly
caring
for
the
baby
.
Ignore
the
answer
above
me
,
btw
!

Can
I
text
from
Canada
to
the
united
states
?
Ok
maybe
that
is
n't
the
right
question
,
but
my
question
is
can
you
text
from
a
united
states
number
when
you
r
in
canada
,
can
you
send
texts
to
another
united
states
number
?
And
do
you
get
charged
for
it
?
I
m
sorry
if
I
could
n't
say
the
question
right
.
I
hope
somebody
understands
what
I
mean
In
short
Yes
.
However
not
in
all
cases
.
If
your
(
US
)
provider
has
a
deal
with
a
canadian
wireless
company
,
you
texts
and
calls
will
go
through
.
They
will
,
however
,
cost
a
bunch
.
The
only
way
to
know
for
sure
is
to
call
611
,
or
your
cell
phone
help
line
,
and
ask
.
The
phones
and
networks
are
compatible
,
so
the
only
reason
it
would
n't
work
would
be
if
you
have
,
say
,
a
cheap
cell
phone
company
..
Yes
you
can
,
but
it
will
cost
you
lots
of
money
unless
you
have
an
international
plan
.
It
varie$
company
to
company
.
You
may
want
to
get
a
temporary
phone
for
your
trip
to
Canada
.
Is
there
any
other
way
to
communicate
or
do
your
friends
only
understand
text
.
Email
usually
free
if
you
use
a
WiFi
connection

I
need
HELP
with
my
Syrian
Hamster
!!!?
Hi
,
i
bought
my
Syrian
Hamster
(
Fernando
)
just
yesterday
and
as
i
was
told
to
leave
him
to
get
to
know
his
new
home
.
As
i
asked
in
the
previous
questions
he
was
jumping
up
the
sides
of
the
cage
but
i
was
told
is
just
becouse
he
is
panicking
and
he
wants
to
escape
but
he

CHILL
OUT
!
Firstly
,
your
hammie
was
not
stressed
out
,
he
wanted
attention
.
Secondly
,
that
is
normal
behavior
as
they
use
the
wheels
in
the
night
.
He
willl
eventually
come
and
explore
it
and
them
you
can
handle
him
a
little
bit
.
Hope
I
helped
!
Give
him
time
.
You
only
got
him
yesterday
.
He
's
probably
still
scared
and
unsure
.
Once
he
has
properly
settled
down
,
got
use
to
the
new
smells
and
noises
he
will
be
fine
.
Once
he
is
more
comfy
with
his
surroundings
,
then
you
can
start
handling
him
and
getting
to
know
each
other
more
.
But
just
give
him
time
for
now
.
Is
Fujairah
a
nice
place
to
live
in
?
My
family
and
I
are
planning
to
shift
to
Fujairah
in
a
couple
of
years
.
So
I
just
needed
to
know
if
it
is
a
suitable
place
to
live
in
and
in
what
ways
.
Also
that
,
I
heard
in
the
next
few
years
Fujairah
would
be
as
good
as
Dubai
,
is
it
true
?
I
'd
be
happy
if
someone
helps
,
especially
someone
who
has
been
to
Fujairah
or
lives
there
.
:)
I
LIVE
THERE
!
...
I
ve
been
living
in
Fujairah
my
entire
life
and
I
must
say
that
it
is
developing
in
a
good
way
.
I
think
2012
is
going
to
be
a
great
year
for
Fujairah
as
we
have
A
LOT
of
projects
to
be
done
by
2012
.
Things
to
do
in
Fujairah
..
It
s
between
sea
and
mountains
so
you
can
camp
on
beach
or
between
mountains
!
...
Fishing
,
Jet
skies
,
snorkeling
,
diving
are
some
of
the
things
you
can
do
for
fun
.
And
now
they
are
finishing
a
road
between
Fujairah
and
Dubai
in
45
minutes
only
!
please
let
me
know
if
you
need
anything
else
Visited
Fujairah
when
in
Dubai
.
Nothing
like
Dubai
,
and
never
will
be
!
Do
n't
know
the
economics
of
Fujairah
but
Dubai
is
basically
bankrupt
so
you
would
n't
want
to
end
up
like
them
!
Unless
you
have
a
particular
skill
they
need
-
and
firm
job
offer
before
going
-
I
would
think
twice
about
it
!
Are
there
any
new
Gaming
console
?
I
do
n't
know
should
i
buy
PS3
or
X
-
BOX
Kinect
.
Or
even
N
-
DS
or
PSP
.
(
Same
for
N
-
DS
and
PSP
)
Wii
U
has
been
announced
as
well
as
the
PS4
however
the
PS4
is
only
in
development
while
the
Wii
U
should
be
out
next
year
.
Microsoft
has
not
announced
there
new
console
yet
though
it
is
believed
to
be
in
the
works
.
I
feel
X
-
BOX
is
a
very
smooth
system
i
own
it
like
3
years
,
it
s
very
compatible
to
previous
versions
and
mostly
important
i
was
very
comfortable
with
the
User
Interface
and
the
JOYSTICK
....
coz
you
do
nt
wan
a
hold
a
joystick
that
gives
you
discomfort
.
Performance
-
You
get
the
same
in
all
,
just
get
a
good
TV
.
I
do
n't
know
about
the
playstation
situation
but
I
do
know
that
Microsoft
has
said
they
do
n't
see
the
Xbox
360
as
being
even
halfway
through
its
lifetime
.
Since
they
released
kinect
this
was
kind
of
their
way
of
releasing
a
new
Xbox
so
they
do
n't
plan
on
making
another
one
for
a
while
.
What
is
the
typical
lifespan
of
a
cat
?
My
cat
had
a
seizure
yesterday
and
was
ill
.
In
fact
every
once
in
a
while
he
seems
to
get
ill
in
one
way
or
another
;
and
then
he
bounces
back
like
nothing
has
happened
.
My
cat
is
18
years
old
.
In
your
experience
how
long
do
cats
do
cats
typically
live
?
Is
he
on
his
last
legs
or
is
it
conceivable
that
he
could
be
around
for
another
15
years
as
is
claimed
by
some
of
the
sources
i
ve
been
looking
at
?
from
my
experience
with
my
cats
13
-
18
years
depending
on
the
breed
.
At
18
years
,
your
cat
has
had
a
long
life
.
Indoor
cats
that
are
well
cared
for
typically
live
11
-
15
years
.
Male
cats
very
seldom
live
past
14
-
15
years
.
Stories
of
cats
living
more
than
25
years
are
rare
.
I
knew
a
cat
that
died
in
its
sleep
aged
21
.
Anything
after
12
is
a
bonus
.
Gaining
and
loosing
my
cockatiel
's
trust
...
?
I
thought
that
I
had
gained
my
cockatiel
's
trust
,
but
now
he
's
not
coming
to
me
when
I
open
his
cage
.
What
do
I
do
?
Did
anything
happen
before
losing
his
trust
?
Birds
are
hard
to
gain
trust
with
,
but
it
's
lost
so
easily
!
A
simple
hand
gesture
could
have
resorted
to
him
being
afraid
of
you
.
Eating
by
his
cage
and
keeping
a
"
sleep
cage
"
in
your
room
is
a
good
idea
.
Keep
his
cage
open
and
go
on
your
computer
,
or
read
a
book
,
etc
and
maybe
he
will
come
out
to
you
.
Let
him
go
at
his
own
pace
,
do
n't
rush
with
him
,
and
never
ever
resort
to
physical
violence
with
your
bird
.
This
with
ruin
your
bond
,
and
you
probably
wo
n't
have
another
chance
to
build
one
.
Patience
is
the
key
.
=)
he
might
never
be
a
cuddly
,
loving
,
tame
bird
,
but
you
can
still
have
a
friendly
bond
.
But
then
again
he
could
be
!
dat
bird
is
smart
.
like
my
dogs
,
they
really
like
me
and
trust
me
,
but
when
I
open
the
door
to
get
them
outside
,
they
run
from
me
,
they
know
I
'm
going
to
take
them
outside
and
they
do
n't
like
it
.
the
bird
must
know
that
when
you
open
the
cage
door
it
means
that
you
will
put
him
in
the
cage
,
and
birds
do
n't
usually
like
cages
.
so
,
I
do
n't
think
the
bird
do
n't
trust
you
,
but
still
do
n't
like
the
cage
.

How
can
i
get
my
kitten
to
stop
biting
when
he
plays
?
I
have
a
kitten
who
just
turned
3
months
today
.
He
's
a
good
kitty
,
just
when
he
plays
he
bites
REALLY
hard
.
Almost
every
day
he
'd
even
wake
me
up
like
5
am
in
the
morning
,
trying
to
bite
my
arm
.
And
when
I
move
it
I
guess
he
figures
I
'm
playing
.
x.x
I
read
somewhere
that
you
have
to
hold
his
mouth
together
,
and
keep
it
that
way
til
he
panics
.
That
seems
cruel
to
me
though
.
Any
other
way
??
Do
you
think
he
's
teething
?
It
's
getting
out
of
hand
.
Yeah
,
I
thought
that
the
holding
his
mouth
thing
sounded
wrong
.
No
worries
,
i
did
n't
try
.
He
'd
just
randomly
walk
up
to
you
and
start
the
biting
.
When
i
put
him
off
of
my
bed
,
he
jumps
back
on
and
same
thing
.
he
may
be
teething
but
i
do
nt
think
it
can
be
stopped
.
maybe
buy
him
toys
that
he
can
play
with
that
give
him
a
way
to
use
his
energy
up
yes
do
not
hold
any
animal
s
mouth
shut
it
wil
close
their
air
way
,
he
s
just
a
kitty
and
they
are
very
rambunctious
,
get
him
toys
.
Hi
,
I
want
to
get
a
few
pet
rats
and
need
a
rat
cage
.
I
ca
nt
decide
between
height
or
width
.
You
always
want
to
go
higher
rather
than
wider
for
rats
.
They
LOVE
to
climb
.
This
cage
will
hold
about
2
-
3
rats
.
Both
are
equal
length
so
go
for
the
taller
one
.
I
used
one
of
these
cages
short
term
for
a
pet
and
it
was
n't
that
great
to
be
honest
,
pretty
cheaply
made
,
the
door
springs
are
annoying
and
it
does
n't
last
very
well
.
I
Have
This
Exact
Cage
,
Bought
From
The
Exact
Ebay
User
.
It
s
Really
Good
And
The
Rat
Calculater
Says
Is
Big
Enough
For
5
Rats
,
But
I
Would
Put
A
Maximum
Of
4
In
It
Really
:)
i
was
reading
the
package
for
a
tank
heater
i
bought
for
my
40
gallon
tank
for
my
snake
and
it
said
it
can
be
put
under
the
tank
or
on
the
side
.
i
m
not
worried
about
damaging
the
surface
my
tank
is
on
because
i
can
prop
it
up
off
the
surface
anyway
.
if
it
s
from
the
side
i
do
nt
have
to
worry
about
propping
it
up
,
but
the
snake
can
still
burn
itself
if
it
slithers
along
the
side
of
the
tank
and
i
also
read
that
it
does
nt
distribute
heat
as
well
?
they
will
move
if
they
get
too
warm
-
it
's
not
like
a
heat
rock
which
you
should
avoid
at
all
costs
.
i
usually
put
my
own
natural
rock
over
the
UTH
and
they
are
perfectly
fine
.
i
have
over
40
corns
,
kings
,
and
milks
and
have
never
had
a
problem
with
the
UTH
system
.
on
the
side
is
a
waste
-
leave
it
on
the
bottom
.
good
luck
!
Bottom
if
you
are
worried
about
the
snake
burning
itself
put
something
overt
it
like
newspaper
...
I
now
use
a
75
watt
basking
or
heat
bulb
for
mine
and
he
seems
to
like
it
put
the
heater
on
the
snake
he
will
love
it
and
the
the
next
day
you
will
have
dinner
What

Question
about
the
sinking
of
the
Titanic
?
After
the
sinking
of
the
Titanic
in
1912
,
was
there
a
law
made
so
that
ships
would
carry
enough
lifeboats
to
save
everybody
on
a
ship
if
it
was
sinking
?
If
yes
,
was
Canada
involved
in
this
act
/
law
?
Sorry
,
I
'm
just
very
nervous
after
watching
the
movie
.
SOLAS
(
Safety
Of
Life
At
Sea
)
,
which
is
an
international
maritime
treaty
,
came
about
in
response
to
the
tragedy
of
the
Titanic
.
Today
,
it
is
the
primary
safety
law
affecting
virtually
all
ships
,
regardless
of
country
of
registration
.
Most
ships
perform
this
drill
before
even
leaving
the
dock
.
SOLAS
covers
just
about
every
aspect
of
safety
at
sea
,
including
minimum
safety
equipment
,
practices
,
and
standards
,
lifeboats
,
navigation
practices
,
fire
protection
,
and
so
on
.
--------------------------------------------------
Edit
:
Also
I
forgot
to
mention
earlier
,
most
(
if
not
all
)
cruise
ships
also
practice
lifeboat
drills
weekly
,
and
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
them
to
actually
launch
the
lifeboats
into
the
water
as
part
of
their
drill
when
you
are
in
port
.
This
not
only
ensures
the
lifeboats
are
operational
and
will
work
if
needed
,
but
makes
the
crew
proficient
at
launching
them
.
I
do
n't
think
so
Do
n't
worry
.
When
was
the
last
time
you
heard
about
a
ship
sinking
?
100
years
ago
?
What
are
some
fun
things
I
could
do
while
in
Japan
?
I
'll
be
in
Okinawa
for
about
a
week
so
I
was
wondering
what
are
some
fun
things
I
could
do
?
I
'm
a
20
year
old
female
travelling
by
myself
so
it
could
be
anything
.
Besides
the
obvious
tourist
spots
which
I
already
have
planned
for
.
How
is
the
night
life
in
Naha
?
Are
there
any
good
venues
that
showcase
underground
bands
,
or
just
a
venue
at
all
?
It
does
n't
have
to
be
underground
it
could
be
any
type
of
music
.
Thanks
Otherwise
,
you
can
do
what
you
can
do
in
other
parts
or
Japan
,
like
shopping
,
eating
,
etc
.
Or
you
can
visit
temples
or
shrines
in
Okinawa
.
Well
first
you
can
try
speaking
Japanese
.
Go
to
a
sumo
tournament
.
Eat
at
a
conveyor
-
belt
sushi
restaurant
.
Climb
Mount
Fuji
.
Okinawa
is
quite
different
from
the
rest
of
Japan
,
although
of
course
there
are
similarities
.
The
main
thing
people
do
there
is
go
to
the
beach
.
There
's
the
market
in
Naha
,
which
is
great
.
You
can
find
all
sorts
of
fresh
food
and
get
a
really
delicious
,
fresh
sashimi
/
sushi
lunch
upstairs
.
Try
the
local
sake
too
if
you
can
.
It
's
a
special
kind
.
I
'm
not
sure
that
there
's
much
nightlife
in
Naha
.
It
's
more
of
a
place
to
go
to
enjoy
the
weather
,
the
sea
,
etc
.
You
might
have
to
make
your
own
nightlife
by
finding
an
izakaya
(
pub
)
somewhere
.
Naha
's
not
a
very
big
city
.
Modern
m
16
vs
Vietnam
m
16
version
?
I
was
playing
a
video
game
that
has
a
m
16
Vietnam
model
,
and
in
the
game
it
's
3
-
shot
burst
.
My
brother
said
they
only
had
full
-
auto
and
semiautomatic
during
Vietnam
.
My
questions
are
..
1
)
what
the
s
difference
between
a
modern
m16
and
Vietnam
m
16
?
He
also
ordered
that
the
receiver
not
get
a
(
I
think
chrome
)
coating
that
helped
keep
the
gun
from
jamming
.
Than
the
troops
being
issued
the
weapon
were
told
it
was
self
-
cleaning
,
which
it
was
n't
.
As
a
result
there
was
a
problem
with
the
weapon
jamming
.
Once
the
troops
started
cleaning
the
weapon
properly
(
even
with
the
dirtier
powder
)
the
Vietnam
era
M
-
16
turned
out
to
be
a
good
weapon
for
the
purpose
it
was
being
used
for
.
The
screw
-
up
was
the
kind
of
things
you
have
happen
when
you
have
bean
-
counters
(
and
McNamara
was
nothing
if
not
a
bean
-
counter
)
instead
of
soldiers
in
charge
of
the
military
.
Today
's
weapons
do
not
have
that
kind
of
problem
,
and
are
much
more
reliable
.

Rotorua

I
'm
assuming
this
was
in

to
the

earthquake
,
do
n't
worry
,
it
was
very
deep
,
so
nothing
was
effected

Since
lots
of
people
are
still
living
there

then
it
must
be
fine

the

What
size
horse
do
i
need
?
I
m
around
5
'

-
5
'
4
,
11
years
old
and
i
m
wondering
what
size
horse
i
'll
need
that
i
wo
nt
grow
out
of
quickly
?
thanks
louise
I
would
say
it
really
depends
on
your
riding
ability
,
what
disciplines
you
are
interested
in
doing
,
or
plan
on
doing
,
etc
.
But
I
would
go
for
the
base
number
of
15
hh
.
It
's
"
tall
"
being
it
's
bigger
than
a
pony
,
but
it
's
on
the
small
end
for
a
horse
.
I
got
my
horse
when
I
was
12
and
I
was
already
5
'
9
-
5
'
10
,
thankfully
I
stopped
growing
when
I
hit
5
'
11
"
but
my
horse
is
about
16.2
or
16.3
hh
,
TB
.
So
do
n't
be
afraid
to
get
something
a
little
bigger
than
"
perfect
"
just
in
case
you
hit
a
growth
spurt
.
A
taller
horse
does
n't
always
mean
a
horse
you
ca
n't
handle
.
Keep
that
in
mind
.
Also
keep
in
mind
whether
you
want
to
be
able
to
jump
up
from
the
ground
,
if
you
even
need
to
,
etc
.
You
just
want
to
be
sure
you
can
groom
and
saddle
sufficiently
and
the
horse
itself
is
calm
enough
so
that
whatever
size
it
is
,
you
can
handle
it
.
i
'm
5
'
3
-
4
"
and
am
21
well
will
be
in
Nov
and
my
horse
is
14.2
hh
and
she
's
perfect
size
for
me
i
can
hop
right
on
with
no
mounting
block
.....
only
with
a
saddle
though
haha
i
ca
n't
bareback
,
not
yet
If
you
Do
n't
want
to
grow
out
of
it
quickly
get
a
14
'
2
..
Anything
smaller
you
will
grow
out
,
anything
bigger
will
be
too
big
and
difficult
to
control
and
manage
,
especially
when
riding
.
Hope
I
helped
:)
Where
in
the
world
is
Iguazu
?
Iguazu
Falls
Widely
considered
to
be
one
of
the
most
spectacular
waterfalls
in
the
world
,
the
Iguazu
Falls
on
the
border
of
Argentina
and
Brazil
,
are
a
certainly
must
see
attraction
in
the
area
.
The
centre
of
the
falls
is
known
locally
as
â€˜
Garganta
Del
Diablo
â€™
(
The
Devil
â€™s
Throat
)
,
where
the
huge
volume
of
water
sends
a
constant
mist
of
spray
into
the
air
.
With
the
sun
shinning
down
on
the
spray
,
creating
a
rainbow
in
the
foreground
,
this
is
the
perfect
place
to
get
that
trademark
Iguazu
Falls
photograph
.
However
,
save
some
of
your
shots
for
the
rest
of
the
falls
,
as
in
total
there
are
around
270
cascades
that
spread
out
over
nearly
2
miles
of
the
Iguazu
River
.
Foz
on
the
Brazilian
side
is
the
larger
town
,
however
both
are
geared
up
to
cater
for
visitors
to
the
Waterfalls
and
National
Parks
,
and
so
offer
a
range
of
accommodation
for
all
budgets
.
For
those
with
a
larger
appetite
for
the
scenery
and
a
larger
budget
,
there
are
some
hotel
complexes
much
closer
to
the
action
with
views
of
parts
of
the
falls
.

London
-
you

the
language
and
will
have
more
fun
.
The
French
tend
to
look
down
on
the
Americans
and
treat
them
bad
.
London
is
a
deliteful
city
to
visit
and
easy
to
get
around
.
You
will
be
able
to
have
a

there

Parisians
dislike
Americans
for
their
lack
of

French
and
proper
French
manners
.
I
was
told
to
leave
a
restaurant
because
I
ordered
water
with
my
meal
(
apparently
this
is
"
washing
down
"
your
food
"
)
and
not
ordering
wine
.
You
'll
need
to
have
intermediate
French
to
have
a
good
time
in
Paris
.
However
,
outside
Paris
everybody
is
wonderful
.
Nobody
likes
the
Parisians
,
even
then
Parisians
do
n't
like
Parisians
.
South
France
is
wonderful
,
right
on
the
Mediterranean
.
It
's
beautiful
and
the
people
are
extremely
friendly
.
I
used
to
live
in
London
for
6
months
and
it
's
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
be
in
the
world
(
I
've
been
to
45
countries
in
5
years
)
.
Everything
about
the
place
is
magical
and
the
people
are
mostly
friendly
.
However
,
if
you
're
allowed
another
option
and
you
want
a
small
-
town
feel
,
then
head
to
Edinburgh
,
Scotland
.
I
lived
there
for
8
months
.
If
your
French
is
good
/
moderate
,
then
head
to
Paris
without
a
doubt
.
I
also
highly
recommend
staying
with
a
French
family
.

there

there

the

that
is

,

that
right

and
they

Then
add
the

They
may

help
with
my

s
bladder
issue
?
I
have
a
1
1
/
2
year
old
female
calico
.
When
she
was
spayed
the
vet
had
a
hard
time
because
she
only
has
one
uterine
horn
and
he
said
this
could
mean
she
only
has
on
kidney
.
Recently
she
has
been
peeing
A
LOT
.
I
'm
talking
soaking
all
the
litter
box
and
then
some
.
She
is
also
peeing
around
the
box
and
somehow
it
gets
underneath
.
I
do
n't
have
the
money
to
take
her
to
a
vet
right
now
but
it
's
getting
to
be
an
issue
.
I
have
to
scrub
the
floor
2
-
3
times
a
week
now
.
What
could
be
the
issue
and
can
I
try
some
home
remedies
first
?
I
love
her
and
want
to
help
her
but
I
do
n't
know
when
I
'll
be
able
to
take
her
to
to
vet
:(
please
help
.
First
of
all
,
I
am
very
sorry
to
hear
you
're
having
this
issue
with
your
cat
.
:(
Frequent
urination
is
a
sign
of
several
things
.
Bladder
or
Urinary
tract
infections
are
two
common
ones
,
but
these
usually
are
frequent
visits
,
with
small
amounts
of
urine
being
passed
.
If
there
is
blood
in
the
urine
,
or
the
cat
seems
to
be
in
pain
,
then
that
is
also
a
good
indicator
.
But
your
cat
is
passing
a
LOT
of
urine
,
and
this
is
bad
.
Signs
of
this
can
be
hard
to
spot
,
and
if
this
is
true
in
her
case
she
will
definitely
need
to
see
a
vet
.
Vomiting
,
bad
breath
,
and
listlessness
.
Seizures
will
occur
when
the
toxins
that
the
kidney
normally
filters
out
are
released
into
the
blood
stream
.
In
the
meantime
make
sure
she
had
plenty
of
water
available
to
her
.

looking
at
the

What
is
Italian
High
Renaissance
?
Have
a
look
at
this
,
it
may
help
.
1
)
The
Italian
Renaissance
began
the
opening
phase
of
the
Renaissance
,
a
period
of
great
cultural
change
and
achievement
in
Europe
that
spanned
the
period
from
the
end
of
the
13th
century
to
about
1600
,
marking
the
transition
between
Medieval
and
Early
Modern
Europe
.
The
term
renaissance
is
in
essence
a
modern
one
that
came
into
currency
in
the
19th
century
,
in
the
work
of
historians
such
as
Jacob
Burckhardt
.
Although
the
origins
of
a
movement
that
was
confined
largely
to
the
literate
culture
of
intellectual
endeavor
and
patronage
can
be
traced
to
the
earlier
part
of
the
14th
century
,
many
aspects
of
Italian
culture
and
society
remained
largely
Medieval
;
the
Renaissance
did
not
come
into
full
swing
until
the
end
of
the
century
.
2
)
The
expression
High
Renaissance
,
in
art
history
,
is
a
periodizing
convention
used
to
denote
the
apogee
of
the
visual
arts
in
the
Italian
Renaissance
.
This
term
was
first
used
in
German
(
Hochrenaissance
)
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
,
and
has
its
origins
in
the
"
High
Style
"
of
painting
and
sculpture
described
by
Johann
Joachim
Winckelmann
.
[
1
]
Over
the
last
twenty
years
,
use
of
the
term
has
been
frequently
criticized
by
academic
art
historians
for
over-simplifying
artistic
developments
,
ignoring
historical
context
,
and
focusing
only
on
a
few
iconic
works
.

Hope
it

I
'm
American
and
I
am
going
to
the
UK
for
the
first
time
,
what
should
I
expect
?
I
just
need
to
talk
to
an
another
american
who
has
gone
to
the
UK
before
so
that
I
know
what
expect
when
arriving
at
the
airport
and
with
going
through
visa
process
and
everything
.
do
you
get
your
visitor
s
visa
immediately
at
the
airport
?
do
you
have
to
go
through
a
medical
exam
right
away
?
drug
test
?
blood
test
?
or
do
i
just
show
them
passport
and
walk
through
the
gates
?
i
have
talked
to
some
people
that
say
that
a
medical
exam
is
an
invasion
of
privacy
and
other
say
it
s
a
routine
thing
when
entering
another
country
.
I
honestly
have
no
idea
what
to
expect
or
prepare
for
and
calling
in
to
get
professional
advice
from
either
of
the
embassies
costs
by
the
minute
-
which
I
really
do
n't
have
the
money
for
.
I
'm
really
worried
cause
I
have
no
idea
who
to
talk
to
and
want
everything
to
go
smoothly
.
An
American
passport
should
get
you
right
into
the
country
,
there
is
no
need
for
a
VISA
,
for
six
months
.
There
is
no
medical
exam
or
blood
test
or
others
like
that
.
You
do
not
need
to
call
the
embassies
to
get
professional
advice
.
Above
is
the
link
to
the
Department
of
State
travel
website
,
which
will
give
you
all
the
info
that
you
need
,
including
passport
information
.
It
is
free
.
I
never
stayed
more
than
two
weeks
at
a
time
when
I
visited
the
U.K
.
You
should
be
fine
with
just
a
passport
,
unless
you
're
staying
longer
than
six
months
.
You
should
double
check
with
the
necessary
embassy
before
you
leave
though
.
I
am
not
sure
how
well
you
planned
this
trip
.
You
'll
have
a
great
time
,
so
no
worries
there
.
I
visited
London
,
Edinburgh
,
and
St.
Andrew
s
so
far
,
and
I
was
treated
very
well
and
with
great
kindness
.
Just
treat
everyone
else
as
you
would
want
to
be
treated
,
and
you
'll
be
fine
.
That
tactic
never
failed
me
.
What
would
you
get
if
you
cross
a
sussex
male
and
a
silkie
female
?
i
had
a
sussex
male
and
a
pekin
female
i
bought
2
silkies
what
would
the
sussex
female
and
the
silkie
females
would
make
?
if
you
had
any
pics
of
your
hens
i
would
like
to
see
them
to
compare
them
to
mine
thanks
?
A
Sussex
crossed
with
Silkie
would
make
a
crossbred
*
mutt
*
chicken
.
There
are
a
lot
of
genetics
at
play
between
a
Sussex
and
Silkie
,
so
the
offspring
would
vary
in
appearance
.
You
do
n't
say
what
color
Silkie
or
Sussex
you
are
dealing
with
so
I
ca
n't
say
what
color
your
chicks
would
be
likely
to
be
.
However
,
I
can
say
what
features
they
would
/
could
have
.
Feather
Type
.
Silkies
have
hookless
feathers
.
All
offspring
from
this
cross
will
have
soft
feathers
,
as
hookless
feathers
are
a
recessive
gene
.
Skin
Color
:
Silkies
have
black
skin
color
,
which
is
dominate
.
Sussex
have
White
Skin
which
could
be
recessive
or
dominate
.
Either
way
rec.
and
dom.
white
genes
dilute
the
black
gene
.
Skin
will
be
darker
but
lighter
then
the
Silkies
.
Beards
/
Muffs
:
If
your
Silkie
has
a
beard
/
muff
the
offspring
could
have
a
beard
as
well
,
as
these
genes
are
incomplete
dominate
.
Crest
:
Chicks
could
also
develop
a
small
crest
due
to
this
being
another
incomplete
dominate
gene
.
Comb
Type
:
Silkies
have
walnut
combs
which
is
actually
genetically
two
comb
types
(
Rose
and
Pea
)
single
is
also
there
,
but
is
recessive
.
So
crossed
to
a
Sussex
you
could
get
a
walnut
,
pea
,
rose
,
or
single
combed
bird
.
Five
Toes
:
Silkies
have
five
toes
.
Sussex
have
four
toes
.
Crossed
together
(
five
toes
is
incompletely
dominate
)
chicks
could
develop
to
have
an
fifth
toe
on
both
,
or
even
one
foot
.
Silkie
crosses
are
great
birds
,
and
very
neat
looking
.

because
she
does
look

of

poses
)
lol
,
he
has
posted
this
so
many
times
today
already
.
clearly
he
s
mad
that
people
know
he
took
her
pic
off
the
net
and
it
's
NOT
his
gf
Not
bad
,
but
too
many
distracting
elements
for
my
taste
.
For
example
:
In
the
photo
on
the
couch
,
the
pillow
she
is
resting
on
clashes
with
everything
else
in
the
shot
.
There
are
also
some
distracting
background
elements
like
the
light
fixture
and
what
looks
like
a
door
handle
on
the
left
.
In
the
standing
photo
(
from
the
front
)
there
is
a
corner
of
a
rug
creeping
in
,
some
kind
of
box
in
the
lower
right
corner
and
what
looks
like
a
power
cord
.
In
the
shot
from
the
back
,
the
crumpled
bottom
of
the
curtain
is
pretty
noticeable
as
well
as
the
power
outlet
.
Compositionally
,
this
one
is
not
my
favorite
,
I
would
suggest
trying
a
different
crop
because
I
do
nt
think
cutting
her
off
at
the
calf
looks
great
.
I
do
like
the
shadow
,
though
.
My
suggestion
is
to
pay
close
attention
to
what
's
going
on
in
the
background
and
if
possible
,
stand
on
a
chair
,
get
on
the
ground
,
do
whatever
you
need
to
do
to
get
rid
of
distracting
elements
.
Using
a
fairly
wide
aperture
is
also
helpful
in
blurring
out
unwanted
background
elements
.
I
've
had
a
few
great
shots
ruined
myself
because
there
was
something
in
the
background
I
did
n't
notice
at
first
.
what
are
some
unique
customs
in
ireland
?
As
far
ask
I
â€™m
aware
our
most
unique
custom
would
be
the
â€œ
Country
Wake
â€
.
In
all
my
travels
I
â€™ve
never
seen
anything
like
it
and
am
often
met
with
an
odd
look
when
I
explain
them
to
foreigners
.
After
a
person
dies
,
their
remains
are
â€œ
waked
â€
in
their
home
for
roughly
2
-
3
days
.
In
this
time
visitors
will
come
to
the
house
,
pay
their
respects
to
the
desisted
and
their
family
and
have
a
couple
of
cups
of
tea
with
a
sandwich
or
a
bun
.
The
wake
also
included
the
night
sit
were
friends
and
family
sit
up
through
the
night
with
the
remains
.
But
only
really
in
the
countryside
.
The
only
notable
difference
I
have
noticed
is
that
in
the
south
of
Ireland
one
night
of
the
wake
is
often
held
in
the
chapel
the
night
before
the
funeral
,
this
tradition
started
after
the
civil
war
.
I
my
self
am
one
but
appreciate
that
the
organization
is
unlikely
to
make
into
the
22nd
century
.
Barn
brack
and
the

the
irish
customs
we
have

are

Do
animals
see
images
on
a
TV
screen
like
humans
do
?
Do
animals
see
images
on
a
TV
screen
like
humans
do
?
I
'm
unsure
of
this
,
because
once
I
watched
a
commercial
of
cat
food
with
my
cat
and
she
did
n't
react
to
seeing
another
cat
on
TV
.
I
heard
that
a
company
(
here
is
a
link
:
http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html
)
is
trying
to
make
a
dog
food
commercial
aimed
at
dogs
,
complete
with
squeaky
chew
-
toy
sounds
,
and
high
pitched
sounds
that
humans
ca
n't
hear
.
As
far
as
I
understand
,
this
ad
will
get
dogs
excited
,
but
my
question
is
:
Can
dogs
actually
see
the
images
featured
in
the
advert
like
humans
?
Also
,
can
animals
remember
images
on
TV
like
us
,
humans
?
If
so
,
then
does
that
mean
that
if
you
watched
a
scary
movie
and
your
dog
/
cat
/
parrot
was
in
the
same
room
as
you
they
will
also
get
scared
?
I
would
n't
know
--
I
do
n't
particularly
like
scary
movies
,
and
I
have
n't
tried
this
with
my
pet
.
Although
,
I
do
n't
think
that
scary
movies
will
affect
pets
for
a
long
time
;
I
am
sure
they
'll
forget
sometime
--
or
am
I
wrong
?
So
what
about
T.V.
?
Do
dogs
enjoy
watching
T.V.
?
Well
,
T.V.
is
a
series
of
flickering
pictures
that
are
streamed
together
to
make
a
moving
picture
.
The
pictures
are
broadcast
at
a
rate
of
about
60
Hz
,
which
is
how
fast
they
need
to
move
for
us
to
see
them
as
a
moving
,
flawless
picture
.
To
a
dog
,
watching
T.V.
is
a
lot
like
watching
and
old
scratchy
silent
film
because
their
flicker
fusion
seems
to
occur
at
a
rate
of
70
to
80
Hz
.
So
they
see
the
pictures
flicker
slower
and
there
for
it
seems
choppy
to
them
.
So
chances
are
that
if
your
dog
likes
to
watch
T.V.
,
it
â€™s
probably
because
of
the
sounds
.
Hearing
is
a
dog
â€™s
secondary
sense
,
and
I
will
discuss
that
in
another
blog
entery
.
Yes
they
do
.
i
m
pretty
sure
that
they
do
see
things
on
the
tv
screen
because
my
cat
chases
things
around
the
tv
screen
How
much
should
I
be
looking
at
for
horse
transportation
?
The
place
where
I
'm
boarding
is
not
likely
to
want
to
take
me
this
far
,
and
I
do
not
have
any
ways
of
hauling
him
myself
.
So
I
want
to
hire
someone
(
or
multiple
people
)
to
transport
me
to
these
shows
.
If
they
ask
how
much
I
'm
willing
to
pay
,
what
is
a
good
price
range
?
I
saw
a
site
that
charges
$
0.70
per
mile
.
Is
that
reasonable
?
Impossible
to
say
,
but
I
guess
you
would
have
to
work
out
fuel
consumption
for
the
particular
vehicle
that
they
are
using
and
pay
a
proportion
of
that
,
and
some
on
top
for
the
driver
's
time
and
effort
,
unless
you
are
able
to
share
transport
with
another
or
more
,
that
would
keep
the
costs
down
.
Remember
that
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.
Rusted
,
torn
corners
in
the
stalls
,
unhealthy
air
,
straight
load
instead
of
slant
load
can
all
make
travelling
hard
,
if
not
downright
dangerous
,
on
your
horse
.
I
had
my
horse
transported
from
CA
to
WA
and
he
came
on
this
big
,
open
stock
trailer
.
He
was
dehydrated
when
he
got
there
and
lost
weight
.
All
horses
I
've
had
delivered
to
me
since
then
are
happy
and
healthy
when
they
arrive
.
I
would
call
Bob
Hubbard
Transport
and
get
a
quote
.
Even
though
you
may
not
want
to
use
them
,
it
will
give
you
some
idea
of
what
it
might
cost
and
what
is
fair
.
See
link
below
.
Make
sure
the
trailer
service
you
use
is
bonded
/
insured
and
knows
something
about
first
aid
.
Do
they
have
this
anywhere
?
I
want
to
take
a
cruise
around
the
world
.
I
mean
literally
around
the
world
if
possible
.
First
of
if
i
went
alone
on
a
regular
cabin
how
much
would
you
estimate
it
would
be
just
a
guess
.
Second
is
there
any
way
to
sort
of
customize
the
places
you
wan
na
go
to
?
Like
you
can
pick
the
destinations
?
But
if
not
just
say
no
but
i
hope
there
is
like
one
out
there
somewhere
.

.
Here
's
a
site
that
lists
world
cruises
including
prices
.
Prices
listed
,
however
,
are
usually
based
on
two
people
in
a
cabin
,
and
you
will
likely
face
some
high
"
single
supplement
"
costs
in
addition
.
(
Two
people
in
a
cabin
will
spend
more
onboard
,
so
cruise
lines
charge
you
more
to
sail
alone
.
You
may
be
able
to
do
better
on
the
rates
if
you
request
competitive
quotes
via
CruiseCompete

Short
of
chartering
your
own
ship
and
crew
,
I
do
n't
see
any
way
you
could
customize
your
own
itinerary
.
Good
luck
!
Various
world
cruises
from
most
of
the
major
cruise
lines
,
typically
100
days
in
duration
.
Travelling
on
your
own
you
would
have
to
pay
double
as
cabins
are
sold
on
the
basis
of
double
occupancy
.
No
possibility
to
customise
ports
of
call
.
Prearranged
about
18
months

the
cruise

,
England
to
Barcelona
(

yes
there
are
multiple
around
the
world
cruises
,
mainly
offered
by
the
more
upscale
lines
.
HOWEVER
:
you
will
pay
as
if
there
are

people
in
the

even
if

There
has
been
a
large
Asian
presence
in
the
SF
Bay
Area
for
a
long
time
--
the
Chinatown
here
was
the
largest
population
of
chinese
outside
of
China
,
there
were
lots
of
Japanese
who
'd
been
displaced
during
WWII
.
The
whole
Western
Addition
and
a
large
portion
of
the
Haight
was
black
.
The
Mission
was
basically
latin
-
american
.
It
was
not
so
long
after
Civil
Rights
laws
against
discrimination
started
to
have
an
impact
.
You
never
saw
black
MUNI
drivers
,
Asian
police
,
Latino
politicians
until
then
.
It
was
an
evolution
.
San
Francisco
was
settled
in
the
19th
and
20th
century
by
mainly
European
immigrants
except
for
some
Asian
workers
who
were
manual
laborers
.
There
has
always
been
a
Mexican
-
American
cultural
influence
since
Calif
was
owned
by
Mexico
.
San
Francisco
was
always
progressive
and
welcoming
and
tolerant
to
all
kinds
of
people
historically
.
EDIT
:
My
memory
may
not
be
good
so
you
might
get
a
more
accurate
answer
from
someone
else
who
remembers
the
time
.
Can
rabbits
and
chickens
live
together
?
I
am
thinking
about
getting
a
rabbit
as
a
pet
,
but
my
parents
said
that
it
has
to
stay
outside
.
We
also
own
two
chickens
that
are
kept
in
a
run
behind
out
garage
/
barn
thing
.
There
is
already
a
little
dog
house
that
I
would
turn
into
a
little
rabbit
hutch
being
kept
back
there
and
I
was
thinking
about
keeping
the
rabbit
in
the
run
with
the
chickens
,
but
keeping
the
chickens
in
the
coop
and
the
rabbit
in
the
hutch
at
night
.
However
,
in
the
day
time
would
it
be
okay
for
the
rabbit
to
hop
around
along
with
the
chickens
?
So
,
can
rabbits
and
chickens
live
together
as
long
as
they
have
separate
places
for
their
food
and
water
?
(
The
rabbit
hutch
would
have
an
opening
only
big
enough
for
the
rabbit
,
the
chickens
would
not
be
able
to
get
to
the
rabbit
food
)
Also
,
is
it
okay
if
the
rabbit
occasionally
sneaks
a
few
bites
of
chicken
feed
?
My
last
rabbit
did
that
a
few
times
,
and
he
was
fine
...
I
just
wan
na
make
sure
:)
Thank
!
Yes
,
but
be
sure
that
your
chickens
are
all
hens
(
I
mean
not
roosters
)
,
Roosters
may
attack
rabbits
or
anything
they
see
moving
,
so
be
aware
of
that
,
hens
are
friendly
with
almost
all
kinds
of
pets
!
From
my
experience
Hens
(
Not
roosters
)
are
very
friendly
with
duck
,
Guinea
pigs
,
kittens
,
cows
,
Rabbits
,
etc
.
Be
sure
not
to
feed
your
rabbits
non-veg
items
!
You
said
they
live
in
different
cages
and
they
are
free
in
day
,
so
no
problem
,
do
n't
put
both
of
them
in
one
cage
because
rabbits
bedding
is
different
than
that
of
hens
,
wet
bedding
can
cause
diseases
in
them
!
So
,
do
n't
put
both
of
them
in
one
cage
.
Good
luck
!
yea
i
guess
but
rabbits
a
easily
escape
a
pen
or
another
rabbit
could
get
in
there
and
that
rabbit
could
be
the
opposite
gender
.
So
be
very
careful
and
some
feeds
could
be
toxic
to
rabbits
and
safe
for
chickens
.
Rabbits
do
burrow
also
so
do
n't
be
surprised
if
chicken
are
falling
into
holes
.
rabbits
are
delicate
and
can
get
diseases
so
watch
out
for
that
.
melting
brass
did
not
work
?
my
friends
and
I
are
trying
to
melt
bras
to
make
some
little
figures
.
we
have
made
a
furnace
as
such
,
we
took
a
clay
flower
pot
with
a
hole
in
the
bottom
put
a
piece
of
steel
pipe
in
the
middle
of
it
with
a
cap
on
the
bottom
,
filled
the
pipe
with
brass
scrap
,
surounded
the
pipe
with
charcoal
lit
it
off
and
pumped
air
through
the
hole
in
the
pot
,
everything
got
red
hot
but
did
not
melt
.
what
am
I
doing
wrong
I
would
recommend
to
start
with
something
more
simple
like
tin
,
pewter
,
aluminum
or
zinc
,
they
all
have
a
much
more
reasonable
melting
point
.
I
'll
just
echo
both
other
answers
.
Molten
brass
is
damn
hot
and
usually
it
's
pressurized
gas
and
forced
air
or
oxygen
.
Even
if
you
did
melt
it
,
I
doubt
you
foresaw
the
issues
of
handling
it
and
pouring
it
.
It
's
really
too
advanced
for
a
beginner
,
both
in
tooling
and
safety
.
Just
the
zinc
fumes
will
get
you
,
if
you
do
n't
take
precautions
.
Pewter
is
perfect
for
what
you
are
doing
,
and
it
melts
on
a
stove
top
.
I
would
recommend
to
start
with
something
more
simple
like
tin
,
pewter
,
aluminum
or
zinc
,
they
all
have
a
much
more
reasonable
melting
point
.
Brass
has
an
even
higher
melting
point
than
bronze
and
I
would
think
your
charcoal
just
does
n't
get
hot
enough
.
I
bet
you
also
did
take
charcoal
as
it
is
used
for
barbecue
which
does
not
get
as
hot
as
real
coal
(
e.g.
for
blacksmithing
one
needs
coal
,
not
barbecue
charcoal
)
.
I
have
done
a
fair
amount
of
metal
casting
,
but
never
tried
to
build
my
own
furnace
,
but
I
think
your
version
is
just
too
small
and
does
n't
get
hot
enough
.
I
melt
brass
and
cast
it
http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm
Brass
melts
at
just
under
2000
F
which
is
a
bright
yellow
heat
,
not
red
hot
.
You
might
be
able
to
make
a
version
of
your
setup
work
,
but
it
would
take
quite
a
bit
of
charcoal
and
a
lot
of
forced
air
.
I
use
propane
with
a
blower
and
a
burner
I
built

and

Some
friends
of
mine
visited
Dartmouth
in
Devon
whilst
on
holiday
last
summer
.
It
s
important
to
their
religion
that
they
only
consume
Halal
food
.
Even
if
you
buy
a
cake
in
a
baker
s
you
can
not
be
too
what
happens
in
the
kitchen
,
for
example
the
cake
may
have
been
sliced
using
a
knife
used
for
preparing
ham
.
We
all
enjoy
buying
a
snack
when
visiting
a
town
or
attraction
while
on
holiday
.
Not
everyone
wants
to
bring
packed
lunch
.
It
s
not
fair
if
some
people
have
to
go
without
buying
food
because
no
place
will
provide
suitable
food
for
them
.
I
think
it
s
only
fair
that
nowadays
every
town
should
provide
at
least
one
halal
cafe
or
restaurant
and
hopefully
one
day
every
British
catering
establishment
will
be
halal
.
When
I
went
to
Bosnia
,
all
the
meat
was
Halal
.
I
could
not
go
to
their
country
and
demand
they
slaughter
and
sell
an
animal
as
meat
the
way
I
prefer
to
eat
it
.
When
you
go
to
another
country
,
you
live
by
their
way
of
life
and
their
laws
,
if
you
do
n't
like
it
,
you
know
how
to
get
back
out
the
country
(
but
I
guess
our
benefits
system
is
too
much
to
throw
away
,
huh
)
.
Cafes
and
restaurants
rarely
use
the
same
cutlery
for
different
food
groups
anyway
,
they
normally
have
blue
for
bakery
items
,
have
red
for
cooked
meat
,
have
brown
for
raw
meat
,
etc
-
all
for
food
preparation
and
hygiene
policies
.
No
.
To
prevent
animal
cruelty
,
many
countries
forbid
Halal
and
Kosher
meat
.
Switzerland
is
one
,
and
the
Netherlands
are
passing
the
same
law
.
It
will
become
EU
law
in
a
couple
of
years
.
We
ca
n't
dictate
what
business
wants
to
open
where
.
If
someone
thinks
there
is
a
business
opportunity
then
they
will
start
opening
halal
only
places
.
How
to
convince
my
parents
to
let
me
get
a
Ball
python
?
They
do
n't
know
ANYTHING
about
Ball
pythons
.
When
I
ask
my
mom
she
says
she
will
never
let
a
snake
in
her
house
.
She
has
no
experience
with
snakes
and
has
never
held
one
.
I
did
all
my
research
and
am
well
prepared
to
keep
one
,
I
'm
14
by
the
way
Lay
some
knowledge
on
them
dude
.
Maybe
if
they
see
how
much
time
and
effort
you
've
devoted
to
researching
the
animal
they
'll
reconsider
.
Tell
them
it
costs
like
8
dollars
a
month
(
if
even
that
much
)
to
keep
it
fed
.
Be
helpful
around
the
house
to
show
that
even
if
you
ca
n't
pay
for
it
yourself
that
you
re
willing
to
work
for
it
.
Maybe
even
try
to
get
your
mom
to
hold
it
a
bit
.
My
wife
was
TERRIFIED
of
snakes
when
we
first
met
,
I
introduced
her
to
one
out
my
baby
corn
snakes
and
she
fell
in
love
with
it
.
Be
persistent
,
but
do
n't
pester
them
about
it
cause
that
'll
get
you
nowhere
fast
.
Good
luck
!
My
general
convince
your
parents
to
let
you
get
a
reptile
advice
:
1
.
Be
responsible
.
Do
all
your
chores
without
being
nagged
,
take
care
of
any
existing
pets
,
keep
your
room
clean
,
and
so
on
.
Prove
,
to
your
parents
'
satisfaction
,
that
you
,
not
they
,
will
be
the
one
actually
taking
care
of
your
new
pet
.
2
.
Save
up
,
and
research
,
so
that
you
are
ready
for
your
new
pet
.
3
.
Bargain
with
them
.
Offer
to
do
extra
chores
,
ask
for
your
pet
as
a
reward
for
good
grades
,
something
like
that
.
4
.
Play
the
sympathy
card
.
If
you
can
find
a
pet
at
a
shelter
,
or
that
a
friend
needs
to
get
rid
of
because
they
're
moving
or
whatever
,
you
might
be
able
to
talk
your
parents
into
"
giving
it
a
good
home
"
where
you
might
not
be
able
to
talk
them
into
buying
a
new
pet
.
On
the
fear
angle
--
talk
her
into
coming
to
the
pet
store
with
you
.
Once
you
're
there
,
ask
if
you
can
hold
a
ball
python
.
Once
you
're
holding
it
,
try
to
get
her
to
touch
/
pet
it
...
My
Snake
's
meal
is
TOO
big
,
what
can
I
do
?
Just
today
I
bought
a
medium
rat
for
my
beloved
Ball
Python
Salazar
(
name
after
Harry
Potter
)
.
Last
time
I
got
a
medium
rat
it
was
a
girl
and
my
snake
handled
her
easily
.
But
today
,
I
got
a
boy
and
realized
that
he
is
HUGE
!
I
really
do
love
my
snake
cause
she
is
actually
an
affectionate
cold
-
blooded
creature
.
So
my
true
question
comes
to
this
,
how
can
I
knock
the
rat
out
?
If
I
threw
him
against
a
wall
and
still
conscious
he
will
run
away
,
do
I
hang
him
by
the
tail
so
the
blood
can
flush
into
his
skull
?
I
really
do
need
answers
and
advice
,
and
NOT
INSULTING
ANSWERS
!!
LIKE
SERIOUSLY
!!
>:(
iw
ould
just
stick
him
in
the
tank
and
let
your
snake
have
a
nice
hunt
for
once
,
snakes
jaws
detach
for
this
sort
of
this
thing
,
so
why
not
give
her
a
good
hunt
,
but
if
you
do
want
him
knock
him
i
d
just
throw
him
against
the
wall
or
something
,,
lol
i
do
nt
know
,
i
agree
with
you
though
throw
him
,
haha
Ok
so
if
youre
snake
will
take
pre-killed
,
you
can
"
gas
it
"
.
If
it
wo
n't
take
pre-killed
and
you
usually
feed
live
then
you
could
hold
the
rat
by
the
tail
and
whack
it
against
a
hard
surface
,
like
a
refrigerator
or
wall
.
I
do
n't
like
that
option
though
-
I
think
it
's
pretty
cruel
and
I'd
not
done
properly
you
'll
end
up
really
hurting
the
rat
but
not
stunning
him
enough
to
stop
possible
injury
to
your
snake
.
You
could
also
just
wait
until
the
rat
passes
out
for
about
1
minute
and
them
feed
it
-
at
this
point
,
it
could
still
have
a
bit
of
a
heart
beat
and
be
slightly
still
alive
.
And
also
maybe
try
holding
the
rat
in
feeding
prongs
so
your
snake
can
get
a
good
hold
and
grip
on
his

Good

My
opinion
-
take
it
for
what
it
's
worth
â€¦
:-)
Looking
to
move
to
Toronto
?
Im
moving
from
South
Carolina
so
this
will
already
be
a
huge
culture
shock
.
Any
suggestions
?
Being
gay
and
living
in
Toronto
is
just
fine
.
You
may
consider
the
Gay
Village
on
Church
Street
,
right
downtown
.
It
is
full
of
gay
friendly
"
everything
"
.
But
,
you
could
live
where
ever
you
fancy
takes
you
.
For
obvious
reasons
,
knowing
how
extremely
difficult
it
is
to
drive
a
car
in
the
city
,
you
should
probably
try
to
be
near
the
subway
system
.
But
,
can
you
immigrate
?
Being
an
American
guarantees
you
no
favours
when
it
come
to
going
to
Canada
.
Start
your
process
here
,
if
you
have
n't
already
.
(
Marrying
a
Canadian
is
not
enough
-
that
does
n't
count
for
at
least
two
years
.
)
A
normal
processing
time
,
unless
you
have
an
advanced
degree
or
a
"
specified
"
skill
is
from
3
-
5
years
.
Coming
to
stay
,
and
overstay
your
three
months
visit
will
lead
to
immediate
expulsion
and
a
lifetime
ban
to
immigrate
to
Canada
-
NOT
GOOD
.
Let
s
be
clear
about
this
...........
Just
'
wanting
to
come
to
Canada
"
is
NOT
enough
.
You
MUST
apply
,
to
become
a
Immigrant
,
and
WAIT
to
be
approved
,
by
the
Canadian
Government
.
So
do
n't
pack
your
bags
,
yet
.
Whatever
you
do
...............
DO
NOT
try
to
come
here
with
out
legal
permission
.
You
will
not
be
able
to
seek
work
or
take
a
job
,
in
Canada
,
with
out
having
to
show
your
Immigration
VISA
and
Canadian
Social
Insurance
Number
card
to
any
potential
employer
.
Being
an
American
and
from
the
"
south
"
you
will
be
noticed
as
soon
as
you
speak
out
loud
.
Do
it
properly
,
and
legally
,
and
you
will
be
OK
.

How
to
train
my
puppy
?
I
have
a
4
months
Shih
Tzu
puppy
.
Recently
I
'm
having
trouble
training
him
.
He
is
kind
of
hate
walking
with
leash
,
every
time
I
put
the
leash
on
,
he
will
try
to
bite
it
.
And
he
is
not
following
me
when
I
was
walking
.
Is
there
any
way
can
let
him
know
how
to
walk
with
leash
?
And
every
time
he
see
some
one
he
will
rush
to
people
and
jump
on
them
,
does
n't
listen
to
me
.
He
is
really
excited
about
anybody
he
see
.
How
to
prevent
this
?
Last
thing
is
every
time
I
sit
on
a
chair
or
something
higher
than
him
,
he
will
try
to
jump
on
,
if
he
ca
n't
,
he
will
bark
all
the
time
until
I
let
him
get
on
,
what
should
I
do
with
this
?
Anyone
have
any
suggestion
?
thank
you
very
much
.
You
need
to
purchase
what
is
called
a
shoulder
point
harness
.
This
type
of
harness
goes
around
the
dog
s
chest
and
legs
and
has
a
clip
for
the
leash
up
on
the
back
of
the
dog
in
middle
of
shoulder
blades
.
This
way
,
he
can
not
reach
the
leash
to
chew
it
.
When
he
swivels
his
head
to
go
for
it
anyway
,
tell
him
sharp
"
UH
UH
"
gently
correct
him
with
a
small
tug
and
continue
your
walk
.
Do
this
repeatedly
and
frequently
and
he
will
learn
to
walk
on
a
leash
.
Patience
is
the
key
here
.
He
is
a
young
pup
and
will
learn
over
time
and
consistency
in
his
training
.
And
always
,
always
train
with
love
and
positive
methods
-
never
hit
or
harshly
scold
.
Never
train
out
of
fear
.
You
want
your
dog
to
admire
you
as
his
pack
leader
,
not
fear
you
.
Good
luck
with
your
puppy
!
Put
him
in
dog
obedience
school
or
call
a
professional
dog
trainer
.
:)
why
do
nt
you
get
some
treats
that
he
loves
and
only
give
him
them
when
he
does
something
right
.
or
,
as
i
saw
on
embarrassing
pets
on
tv
,
get
a
clicker
type
thing
and
treats
as
well
.
try
to
train
him
to
heel
,
which
means
to
walk
round
you
before
he
needs
to
go
on
a
leash
,
and
he
may
do
that
.
or
you
could
even
spray
some
scented
spray
on
the
leash
and
he
will
go
for
the
scent
and
probably
,
if
you
act
quick
enough
,
will
stay
on
the
leash
.
What
sort
of
Hotel
could
I
expect
to
find
in
New
Delhi
/
Agra
/
Varanasi
for
rs
500
per
night
?
Hey
guys
.
I
'm
looking
to
visit
India
with
some
mates
at
the
beginning
of
February
next
year
and
I
am
wandering
what
standard
of
accommodation
we
could
get
for
Rs
500
per
person
per
night
.
There
would
be
four
of
us
so
we
would
probably
be
looking
at
2
twin
rooms
for
Rs
1000
,
close
to
the
centre
of
these
cities
.
This
would
be
on
a
walk
-
in
basis
as
we
want
to
have
the
freedom
of
finding
a
place
that
looks
good
(
Not
relying
on
pictures
from
the
internet
)
and
is
in
a
spot
we
like
.
Thanks
in
advance
for
sharing
your
experience
!
Sorry
,
almost
forgot
to
ask
-
Would
it
be
cheaper
to
walk
-
in
to
these
hotels
rather
than
pre
book
?
In
Delhi
I
'd
recommend
Ajay
Guesthouse
.
Travelled
to
Delhi
twice
and
stayed
there
twice
.
Rooms
start
from
500
per
double
.
Those
ones
are
quite
small
.
Must
say
,
in
Delhi
it
's
hard
to
get
good
price
/
quality
rating
.
I
have
found
this
hotel
in
the
Lonely
Planet
guide
.
It
's
in
an
area
starting
with
a
P
,
many
tourist
hotels
there
and
the
location
is
very
nice
.
But
in
general
,
Delhi
is
the
hardest
place
to
find
a
nice
clean
hotel
for
that
price
.
In
Varanasi
I
do
n't
know
.
Also
,
while
travelling
ask
people
where
they
've
been
and
if
they
have
any
hotel
recommendations
.
In
Agra
I
've
stayed
in
a
place
fellow
travellers
recommended
,
they
found
it
in
the
Rough
Guide
.
It
was
nice
and
close
to
the
Taj
.
It
was
quite
easy
to
find
something
.
(
Do
nt
stay
in
Agra
too
long
.
One
night
is
enough
!
)
There
were
many
hotels
there
.
I
ve
paid
500
for
a
double
room
there
and
it
was
fine
and
clean
.
Good
luck
,
enjoy
your
time
!
You
may
find
a
normal
budget
hotel
for
Rs
1000
per
night
in
the
cities
you
mentioned
,
the
links
below
may
help
you
to
find
good
hotels
in
Delhi
and
Agra
.
it
is
in
karol
bagh
.
some
beautiful
locations
like
close
to
Karol
Bagh
Shopping
Market
,
Presidential
Palace
,
and
Birla
Mandir
Temple
and
Connaught
Place
and
Jantar
Mantar
are
near
to
it
.
TO
Stay
in
Agra
-
Hotel
Atithi
and
Aditya
Palace
is
perfect
for
you
.
it
is
centrally
situated
.
To
Stay
in
Varanasi
-
Sandeep
Hotel
is
you
choice
...
a
degu
,
a
rat
,
a
mouse
,
a
hamster
or
a
guinea
pig
?
Get
a
guinea
pig
.
So
my
opinion
is
Guinea
pigs
.
(
plus
they
do
nt
stink
that
bad
)
Depends
on
what
you
want
in
a
pet
,
to
be
honest
.
Also
depends
on
the
space
you
have
,
how
much
time
you
can
handle
the
pet
,
how
much
money
you
can
spend
,
etc
.
I
've
had
experience
with
all
of
those
pets
except
Degus
.
My
favorite
would
have
to
be
the
rat
.
They
're
incredibly
social
,
highly
trainable
,
and
very
clean
.
Mine
learned
to
"
go
to
the
bathroom
"
only
in
their
cages
and
loved
to
ride
on
my
shoulder
or
hang
out
in
my
hoodie
pouch
.
The
only
downside
is
they
should
be
kept
in
pairs
or
trios
and
require
a
pretty
large
habitat
.
That
means
expense
,
space
,
and
they
require
weekly
cage
cleaning
.
Again
,
pairs
or
trios
and
pretty
big
living
space
.
They
,
too
,
need
weekly
cage
cleaning
and
can
cost
quite
a
bit
.
I
've
never
met
a
hamster
that
did
n't
bite
me
.
Never
had
/
handled
a
Degu
.
Get
a
guinea
pig
.
We
have
two
.
They
are
social
and
like
to
be
handled
.
You
have
to
have
two
because
they
do
n't
do
well
alone
.
Make
certain
you
get
two
females
.
Two
males
can
fight
and
you
definitely
do
n't
want
babies
!!
Guinea
pigs
(
also
called
cavies
)
are
gentle
creatures
and
are
awake
during
the
day
and
sleep
at
night
.
They
will
whistle
when
they
hear
you
as
an
encouragement
for
you
to
give
them
a
treat
like
leaf
lettuce
.
They
love
leaf
or
romaine
lettuce
and
tomatos
,
celery
,
cucumbers
,
carrots
.
Do
n't
feed
them
broccoli
,
cauliflower
,
garlic
,
onions
,
head
lettuce
....
they
are
all
too
difficult
for
them
to
digest
.
If
you
keep
the
cage
clean
they
do
n't
smell
and
you
can
buy
spray
on
cleaser
for
them
,
just
massage
it
into
their
coat
and
groom
them
.
Fostering
6
week
old
kittens
and
HATING
IT
!
Need
Advice
!?
I
wanted
to
volunteer
and
help
animals
,
and
decided
to
try
fostering
kittens
.
This
is
my
first
experience
and
I
have
two
six
week
old
kittens
right
now
and
am
at
my
wit
s
end
.
I
do
not
want
to
have
to
bring
them
back
before
they
are
eight
weeks
old
but
they
are
ruining
my
apartment
.
They
track
poop
everywhere
(
most
disgustingly
my
bed
....
)
,
and
am
constantly
trying
to
climb
up
everything
,
including
my
bare
legs
!
My
legs
and
hands
are
just
full
of
scratches
.
I
realize
they
are
young
and
that
cats
do
climb
,
but
this
is
just
ridiculous
.
My
apartment
also
smells
repulsive
even
though
I
am
cleaning
out
their
litter
box
at
least
once
a
day
if
not
twice
.
Any
suggestions
and
helpful
hints
to
make
this
a
more
positive
experience
would
be
extremely
appreciated
.
That
's
kind
of
the
way
it
goes
..
lol
.
Limit
them
to
one
room
with
easy
to
clean
flooring
.
If
you
have
limited
options
,
try
the
bathroom
.
Make
sure
there
are
plenty
of
litter
boxes
that
are
cleaned
often
.
Depending
on
the
batch
of
kittens
,
I
will
often
have
as
many
as
one
per
kitten
.
They
can
produce
a
lot
of
waste
and
even
scooping
twice
a
day
they
can
get
messy
.
For
some
reason
it
takes
them
awhile
to
learn
not
to
step
in
poop
.
Also
if
they
have
diarrhea
,
check
in
with
your
foster
coordinator
.
They
made
need
medication
or
deworming
or
something
.
But
in
the
meantime
,
highly
recommend
jeans
and
long
sleeves
anytime
you
'll
be
interacting
with
the
kittens
.
Then
take
care
of
yourself
.
Get
plenty
of
sleep
and
make
sure
you
take
time
out
to
do
some
things
you
enjoy
.
Try
visiting
the
kittens
a
few
times
a
day
for
short
periods
of
time
.
Try
to
go
in
there
with
the
right
frame
of
mind
and
enjoy
them
for
what
they
are
.
If
you
still
do
n't
enjoy
the
kittens
,
see
what
other
opportunities
are
available
.
They
may
need
foster
homes
for
adult
cats
in
different
situations
..
sick
,
recovering
from
surgery
,
need
a
little
socialization
,
etc
.
Generally
they
're
not
clawing
and
biting
,
they
do
n't
make
nearly
as
much
mess
,
they
do
n't
need
nearly
as
much
litterbox
scooping
,
etc
:)
Decide
volunteering
is
not
your
thing
and
give
them
back
!
And
do
more
research
before
you
agree
next
time
;-)
Take
the
kittens
back
to
the
shelter
.
Maybe
do
volunteer
work
at
the
humane
society
,
walk
dogs
,
groom
the
animals
etc
.
what
r
the
requirements
to
apply
for
a
delay
birth
certificate
in
canada
?
what
r
the
evidentary
requirements
to
apply
for
a
delay
birth
certificate
in
canada
?
including
fees
and
forms
It
depends
on
if
you
ever
registered
the
birth
.
Some
places
do
the
registration
right
at
the
hospital
....
in
some
smaller
places
,
you
need
to
register
your
child
's
birth
at
the
town
hall
/
registrar
's
office
.
The
birth
registration
was
done
right
in
hospital
.
My
last
son
,
was
born
in
Northern
Ontario
....
I
did
n't
know
that
I
did
n't
register
him
in
the
ridiculous
amount
of
paperwork
I
had
filled
out
in
the
hospital
and
was
supposed
to
go
to
city
hall
within
90
days
.
Two
years
later
when
I
got
around
to
filling
for
his
birth
certificate
,
I
find
out
he
was
never
registered
.
I
had
to
call
the
Office
of
the
Registrar
General
in
Thunder
Bay
,
have
copies
of
the
delayed
registration
form
mailed
out
to
me
,
as
they
do
n't
have
an
online
area
for
it
yet
,
fill
those
out
,
send
them
away
,
then
apply
for
his
birth
certificate
.
If
you
are
just
applying
for
a
birth
certificate
for
the
first
time
,
it
s
simple
to
do
it
over
the
computer
.
For
$
56
you
can
even
have
it
expedited
and
will
get
in
three
business
days
or
your
money
back
.
This
is
in
Ontario
of
course
,
the
rates
may
be
slightly
different
for
other
provinces
/
territories
.
You
just
need
basic
information
,
and
answer
a
few
questions
like
what
hospital
was
the
child
born
at
/
who
was
the
doctor
....
None
,
just
walk
in
to
the
service
office
and
present
all
the
identification
you
have
to
prove
your
identity
.
they
may
then
chose
to
ask
you
to
bring
more
evidence
,
or
just
look
up
the
record
and
hand
you
the
certificate
.
You
can
probably
do
it
all
on
-
line
.
Start
here
if
you
were
born
in
Ontario
.
If
you
were
born
elsewhere
,
start
here
.
Good
luck
My
parents
did
n't
send
for
my
birth
certificate
until
I
was
16
and
needed
it
for
summer
employment
.
It
was
no
problem
to
get
PROVIDED
the
birth
was
registered
in
the
first
place
.
I
add
that
in
because
there
have
been
some
people
who
have
tried
to
claim
citizenship
by
sending
for
their
birth
certificate
when
they
were
never
really
born
in
Canada
or
to
Canadian
parents
.
When
a
child
is
born
in
Canada
the
birth
is
registered
before
the
baby
can
leave
the
hospital
.
As
long
as
that
was
done
you
can
send
for
it
at
any
time
.
Each
provincial
government
has
a
website
that
lists
the
process
for
that
Province
so
depending
upon
where
you
were
born
you
can
google
it
.

Some
cruise
aficionados
refuse
to
sail
on
one
or
the
other
.
Are
there
any
major
differences
between
them
?
Explore
which
cruise
may
fit
your
needs
the
best
.
Itinerary
Both
ships
go
to
Caribbean
Islands
like
Jamaica
,
Grand
Cayman
,
Cozumel
,
St.
Thomas
,
the
Bahamas
and
St.
Martin
/
St.
Maarten
.
The
Liberty
also
visited
its
private
island
Half
Moon
Cay
,
Puerto
Rico
,
and
Grand
Turk
.
We
loved
most
of
the
locations
that
both
of
the
ships
visited
and
do
n't
believe
that
this
should
be
a
distinguishing
factor
on
deciding
between
the
cruise
lines
.
Shows
Each
night
there
are
a
variety
of
shows
.
Usually
you
have
the
main
show
and
some
type
of
entertainment
before
and
perhaps
afterward
.
On
the
Liberty
we
liked
the
comedian
and
juggling
act
.
We
did
have
one
waiter
that
complained
some
on
one
of
our
trips
on
the
Mariner
.
They
both
had
pools
for
kids
and
adults
.
We
liked
the
Liberty
's
pools
better
because
one
had
a
slide
.
If
you
have
kids
,
this
would
be
something
that
they
would
definitely
enjoy
.
Spa
We
tried
the
spa
on
the
Liberty
and
loved
it
.
Usually
you
ca
n't
go
wrong
when
getting
a
spa
treatment
......

Royal
Caribbean
.
Carnival
has
been
called
the
WalMart
of
cruise
lines
...
I
really
want
to
travel
when
I
leave
school
!
Where
in
the
states
could
I
go
?
Where
in
Europe
?
Have
you
every
traveled
before
?
How
long
should
I
go
for
to
each
place
?
(
I
Have
1
year
before
collage
!
)
&
Also
how
much
money
would
I
need
?
So
I
can
start
saving
now
hehe
Thanks
:)
I
mean
when
I
graduate
&
yes
,
college
,
sorry
for
the
typo
.
Leave
High
School
?
Lots
of
places
.
There
are
50
of
them
,
48
located
from
Maine
to
Florida
and
California
to
Washington
State
and
all
in
between
.
There
are
2
more
located
outside
of
the
main
continent
with
Alaska
way
to
the
north
and
Hawaii
in
the
Pacific
.
What
do
you
like
to
do
?
Big
Cities
like
New
York
,
Boston
,
Philadelphia
on
the
East
Coast
.
Beaches
and
Disney
of
Florida
or
the
Mid
Atlantic
cities
of
Atlanta
,
Savannah
,
Charleston
.
The
federal
sites
of
Washington
,
DC
.
Southern
charm
of
Nashville
,
Birmingham
,
New
Orleans
or
Charlotte
.
West
Coast
hot
spots
like
Seattle
,
Portland
,
San
Francisco
,
Los
Angeles
or
San
Diego
.
Europe
?
Just
as
numerous
as
the
possibilities
of
the
US
.
Do
you
speak
a
foreign
language
?
I
could
spend
a
year
in
Spain
alone
.
From
Madrid
to
Seville
to
Barcelona
an
Valencia
.
Bilboa
on
the
north
coast
,
Pamplona
and
the
very
famous
Guernica
.
A
road
trip
to
Lisbon
and
the
Algarve
in
Portugal
before
a
mountain
escape
in
the
Pyrenees
and
a
stop
in
Andorra
before
heading
over
to
France
and
Italy
and
Austria
and
Switzerland
.
I
've
traveled
to
all
of
these
places
and
could
certainly
tailor
a
trip
to
your
needs
based
on
budget
,
actual
time
allowed
,
your
likes
and
dislikes
.
Amount
of
time
could
be
dependent
on
so
many
things
.
Do
you
want
to
see
all
the
sites
or
simply
a
few
photos
and
on
your
way
to
the
next
place
.
Does
your
budget
limit
you
to
how
long
you
can
stay
in
each
place
?
You
need
a
lot
of
money
for
hotels
,
airfare
,
seeing
the
sites
,
food
,
local
transport
-
you
name
it
but
life
costs
.
Once
you
have
a
budget
or
an
amount
in
the
bank
then
you
'll
be
able
to
figure
out
where
you
can
go
,
for
how
long
you
can
go
and
what
you
can
do
when
you
're
there
.
1
year
before
collage
or
college
?
Good
luck
.
I
recommend
buying
a
single
unlimited
Europass
and
travelling
anywhere
in
the
EU
your
heart
desires
.
You
ca
n't
beat
the
price
for
what
you
get
.
come
to
Africa
.
Nigeria
,
a
lovely
country
.
But
where
in
nigeria
?
Obudu
cattle
ranch
.
More
than
a
tourist
centre
.
How
do
you
make
your
cat
adjust
to
a
new
house
?
Me
and
my
family
are
moving
into
a
new
house
just
outside
a
small
town
.
We
are
currently
living
a
mile
from
the
town
in
a
house
surrounded
by
fields
but
the
new
house
is
beside
a
busy
road
.
We
have
had
the
cat
for
10
years
and
do
nt
want
to
leave
it
.
How
could
we
make
it
settle
in
a
new
house
.
you
are
not
just
moving
house
-
your
cat
is
losing
his
territory
.
you
will
need
to
give
him
only
a
small
place
to
explore
,
so
he
can
make
it
his
territory
,
and
feel
safe
there
.
then
,
he
can
have
a
place
to
retreat
to
when
he
feels
scared
.
you
will
need
to
get
his
box
and
bowls
,
and
whatever
blanket
and
toys
are
his
,
and
smell
like
home
,
and
put
him
in
a
room
.
close
the
door
,
and
keep
him
in
there
for
a
week
.
he
will
explore
the
room
,
mark
everything
with
his
cheek
,
and
try
to
make
it
feel
like
his
territory
.
he
will
reassure
himself
that
no
other
animal
is
in
there
,
and
that
no
other
animal
will
come
in
-
he
is
afraid
that
he
is
in
someone
else
's
territory
when
he
is
in
a
new
house
.
in
a
week
's
time
,
he
will
have
made
it
his
,
and
will
be
getting
more
bored
than
afraid
.
let
him
out
for
half
an
hour
,
to
explore
.
then
put
him
back
in
.
extend
the
time
he
is
out
each
day
,
but
for
the
first
month
,
always
put
him
in
his
room
at
night
,
so
he
feels
safe
to
sleep
.
soon
he
will
make
the
whole
house
his
,
but
he
needs
that
one
safe
place
to
start
from
.
remember
to
visit
with
him
while
he
is
in
the
room
,
and
tell
him
how
good
he
is
.
remember
to
give
him
the
time
he
needs
to
feel
that
the
room
is
his
-
rush
it
,
and
he
will
be
afraid
of
the
whole
house
for
a
long
time
.
he
might
even
start
peeing
on
things
in
fear
.
good
luck
with
your
new
house
and
with
his
new
territory
!
Let
her
explore
when
we
moved
my
cat
had
to
explore
the
entire
house
before
she
felt
comfortable
.
In
time
though
she
/
he
will
adjust
.
:)
they
just
do
it
on
their
own
.
Last
night
,
I
adopted
a
2
year
old
Male
German
Shepherd
.
(
He
is
92
pounds
)
He
does
not
listen
to
any
commands
,
but
my
major
problem
is
that
he
will
not
go
outside
on
command
,
or
even
with
me
.
I
will
walk
outside
and
he
will
stand
at
the
door
and
stare
at
me
or
run
away
.
My
other
MAJOR
problem
is
that
he
will
not
get
in
his
crate
.
I
will
get
a
treat
and
try
to
get
him
in
there
that
way
,
it
wo
nt
work
.
He
wo
nt
even
get
close
to
the
crate
.
If
I
come
towards
him
,
he
will
run
away
.
How
do
I
train
him
to
feel
comfortable
in
his
crate
?
and
to
willingly
go
outside
...
and
to
come
on
command
.
He
wo
nt
do
anything
on
command
.
It
s
very
frustrating
.
I
have
a
9
month
old
German
Shepherd
that
I
raised
from
a
puppy
.
I
trained
her
myself
.
She
is
crate
trained
,
potty
trained
,
and
can
sit
,
lay
down
,
stay
,
come
,
fetch
,
and
will
even
stay
in
a
down
position
while
I
throw
a
treat
across
the
floor
or
even
right
next
to
her
paw
,
and
she
wo
nt
get
it
until
I
give
her
the
command
.
Yes
,
lots
of
time
and
lots
of
patients
...
I
just
do
nt
know
how
to
do
it
with
a
grown
dog
.
She
tosses
me
around
like
it
s
nothing
!
...
but
basically
,
what
I
do
is
the
same
thing
I
did
with
my
puppy
...
lots
of
patience
,
lots
of
time
,
lots
of
praise
,
lots
of
treats
,
and
lots
of
repition
....
Right
?
Is
there
any
tricks
I
could
use
?
Maybe
get
a
book
on
training
.
You
have
to
be
in
command
at
all
times
.
There
are
ways
to
get
your
new
dog
used
to
the
crate
or
going
out
.
I
would
start
with
a
leash
.
Put
the
leash
on
the
dog
and
just
walk
around
the
crate
a
few
times
.
Then
take
the
leash
off
and
do
nothing
else
but
that
.
Later
do
it
again
.
When
the
dog
is
ok
with
this
,
then
open
the
door
and
walk
around
the
crate
,
leave
the
door
open
all
the
time
.
Put
something
fun
inside
.
Let
your
dog
go
in
when
he
wants
to
for
no
reason
.
Do
not
shut
the
door
.
Let
him
walk
in
and
out
for
a
few
days
.
At
some
point
he
will
feel
ok
with
this
and
you
can
then
close
the
door
but
not
for
long
at
all
.
Open
the
door
and
let
him
out
and
see
how
he
acts
.
If
you
push
it
,
it
will
never
work
.
With
going
outside
,
put
the
leash
on
and
just
take
him
for
a
walk
.
He
will
learn
to
really
like
this
.
Potty
outside
will
come
at
some
point
.
Try
obedience
classes
.
Have
patience
with
him
,
you
just
got
him
and
who
knows
how
he
was
treated
before
you
brought
him
home
.
will
only
be
in
Ho
chi
Minh
for
4
days
and
I
am
looking
for
a
1
day
or
2
day
trip
to
Mekong
delta
.
I
have
been
researching
on
line
and
find
things
are
quite
pricey
but
the
tours
look
great
.
Should
I
just
settle
and
book
on
line
?
If
I
wait
,
would
the
tours
I
find
there
for
less
money
be
the
same
quality
type
tours
?
Also
,
any
tour
recommendations
would
be
very
helpful
a
well
.
Thank
you
!
If
you
want
reliable
and
inexpensive
...
try
Sinh
Cafe
/
Tourist
.
The
are
located
right
at
248
De
Than
St.
in
the
heart
of
the
back
packer
district
.
I
have
taken
this
tour
and
it
was
great
.
I
did
an
overnight
in
a
home
stay
that
was
sweet
and
the
water
market
was
wonderful
.
I
do
n't
remember
the
exact
cost
but
remember
thinking
how
inexpensive
it
was
.
Also
,
Sinh
Cafe
has
been
around
for
a
long
time
and
is
very
reputable
.
And
no
,
I
do
not
work
for
them
.
:)
I
am
just
a
satisfied
customer
.
And
do
n't
expect
to
party
on
this
tour
.
Very
few
clubs
and
night
activities
.
Oh
,
if
you
are
confused
.
Sinh
Cafe
is
not
a
Cafe
.
It
is
a
tour
agency
and
they
have
their
own
buses
etc
.

fun
.
There
is
n't
much
to
see
in
the
delta
,
it
's
a
lifestyle
not
a
resort
area
.
If
you
're
adventurous
you
can
take
a
bus
or
water
taxi
to
My
Tho
(
near
where
we
live
)
or
Can
Tho
.
From
either
of
those
cities
,
you
can
venture
out
and
spend
a
day
in
the
country
.
Most
of
the
tourists
that
I
've
come
across
buy
tours
along
the
My
Tho
waterfront
.
You
take
a
boat
across
the
river
,
then
spend
a
day
biking
,
eating
at
a
local
restaurant
,
buying
souvenirs
and
doing
other
things
that
are
geared
towards
tourists
.
The
countryside
is
very
beautiful
,
especially
if
you
have
a
few
months
(
or
years
)
to
get
to
know
the
place
.
PS
,
If
you
make
it
to
Thanh
Pho
Ben
Tre
,
stay
a
night
at
my
friend
Ken
's
hotel
.
It
's
called
Kiwi
Heaven
and
it
's
across
the
river
from
Cho
Ben
Tre
.
It
's
a
little
hard
to
get
to
by
foot
,
they
're
rebuilding
the
bridge
,
but
you
can
get
someone
to
moto
-
taxi
you
there
for
a
dollar
or
less
.
He
's
an
ex-pat
from
New
Zealand
and
he
's
been
in
town
for
awhile
.
He
'll
set
up
a
real
tour
of
the
area
for
you
,
not
some
tourist
fantasy
.
Have
a
good
trip
where
-
ever
you
end
up
.
We
went
with
Intrepid
as
a
part
of
their
North
to
South
Vietnam
Trip
,
but
they
do
offer
this
one
day
separately
.
We
had
a
great
time
and
visited
a
location
where
they
made
coconut
candies
,
visited
a
local
restaurant
which
was
attached
to
a
fish
farm
,
rode
in
modified
quad
bikes
and
had
some
tropical
food
at
what
appeared
to
be
a
local
hangout
.
Intrepid
is
good
at
getting
you
away
from
the
most
touristy
spots
and
showing
you
something
a
little
different
.
yoga
and
horses
.....
?
I
got
a
riding
lesson
today
on
one
of
my
boss
's
fino
horses
and
it
made
me
realize
just
how
unsteady
my
left
leg
is
.
I
mentioned
it
to
my
boss
and
she
said
to
start
doing
yoga
.
But
there
are
just
so
many
poses
and
programs
!
Any
good
poses
or
programs
(
I
'm
willing
to
buy
a
dvd
as
long
as
it
is
under
$
20
)
to
help
specifically
with
leg
stabilization
?
I
just
have
a
few
issues
supporting
my
back
and
my
left
leg
flops
.
Because
I
do
n't
feel
like
spending
over
$
20
on
a
freakin
DVD
I
also
have
back
problems
that
transfer
into
my
legs
.
I
have
done
Yoga
for
riders
for
a
while
,
a
20
minute
routine
I
found
on
YouTube
(
I
think
it
s
called
"
Yoga
for
horse
back
riding
"
hosted
by
a
man
)
It
helped
with
noticing
slight
differences
in
my
balance
and
weight
distribution
but
helped
not
really
for
the
way
I
use
my
legs
and
back
.
Here
is
what
I
do
now
and
it
really
helps
....
When
I
first
get
on
I
take
1
leg
and
pull
it
back
up
to
touch
my
butt
with
my
heel
and
hold
it
there
for
1
lap
at
a
walk
around
a
large
dressage
arena
.
Then
the
same
thing
with
the
other
leg
.
Then
1
lap
at
a
walk
around
the
arena
with
both
my
legs
pulled
out
as
far
as
I
can
,
so
they
are
not
touching
the
saddle
.
Then
a
lap
doing
scissors
,
one
leg
forward
as
far
as
I
can
and
the
other
back
,
then
switch
legs
.
If
the
weight
is
going
into
your
heels
(
it
throws
your
leg
forward
)
put
the
stirrups
up
against
the
heel
of
your
boot
.
Do
a
nice
working
trot
,
not
a
slow
trot
.
All
this
will
help
you
use
both
legs
evenly
,
keep
proper
contact
and
use
your
wight
correctly
,
to
keep
your
leg
in
a
good
position
.
BTW
you
do
nt
want
your
leg
locked
in
place

move
WITH
the
horse
a
bit
.
When
I
first
started
doing
it
I
'd
do
it
every
day
.
Now
I
just
do
it
once
or
twice
a
week
or
as
needed
.
what
are
you
having
problems
with
?
i
would
n't
bother
with
yoga
i
'd
practice
more
with
riding
and
fixing
my
problem
,
ride
bareback
,
with
no
irons
,
there
s
also
a
way
to
ride
on
your
knees
?
that
help
alot
with
your
thigh
muscles
(
bareback
though
)
ya
i
really
would
n't
bother
with
the
yoga
maybe
a
back
brase
will
help
,
sometimes
my
back
really
gets
to
me
and
i
've
thought
about
getting
one
.
with
your
leg
flopping
,
just
try
putting
all
your
weight
in
your
heel
and
hang
on
with
only
your
legs
,
holding
my
leg
back
helps
me
with
flopping
the
more
it
's
forward
the
more
it
flops
:/
work
your
calf
muscles
,
maybe
try
standing
on
the
edge
of
your
steps
(
on
the
ball
of
your
foot
)
and
balance
to
strengthen
those
muscles
You

n't
want

spend
more
than

and
yet
you
have
an

like

What
to
feed
my
dog
after
gastroenteritis
?
My
dog
has
been
sick
for
about
3
days
now
.
He
has
been
having
diarheya
everywhere
and
he
began
to
vomit
last
night
.
I
thought
it
would
pass
until
he
started
to
vomit
blood
and
would
nt
drink
any
water
.
I
took
him
to
the
Animal
Hospital
and
they
ran
blood
work
and
everything
came
back
normal
.
No
pancreatitis
or
anything
abnormal
.
So
my
question
is
..
Is
it
normal
for
dogs
to
throw
up
blood
while
having
gastroenteritis
?
and
will
these
antibiotics
help
?
I
have
tryed
to
give
him
water
but
he
wo
nt
take
it
..
what
should
i
do
?
i
do
nt
want
him
to
get
dehydrated
and
also
should
i
try
to
give
him
a
little
bit
of
food
?
...
Some
help
would
be
great
.
thank
you
:)
They
did
nt
take
x
-
rays
they
offered
them
but
i
just
could
nt
afford
any
more
treatment
.
I
will
give
them
and
call
and
see
what
they
say
.
Thank
you
for
the
help
.
Ok
so
i
spoke
to
the
vet
and
he
said
the
give
him
white
rice
and
boiled
chicken
but
only
a
little
at
a
time
.
To
answer
your
questions
in
order
:
1
)
It
is
not
normal
for
dogs
to
be
vomiting
,
much
less
to
have
blood
in
it
.
However
,
if
they
have
been
vomiting
numerous
times
,
then
the
blood
could
be
due
to
irritation
of
the
stomach
and
intestines
.
He
could
also
have
Parvovirus
,
a
GI
foreign
body
,
or
any
number
of
things
.
Did
your
vet
take
radiographs
(
x
-
rays
)
?
2
)
Your
vet
would
not
prescribe
them
if
they
did
n't
think
it
would
be
helpful
.
3
)
If
he
shows
no
interest
in
water
,
then
take
him
back
to
your
vet
.
It
could
be
due
to
nausea
or
any
number
of
things
.
He
could
become
severly
dehydrated
(
especially
if
he
continues
to
vomit
and
have
diarrhea
)
.
And
being
dehydrated
,
vomiting
,
and
having
diarrhea
just
does
n't
feel
good
.

)
Call
your
vet
.
They
should
have
discussed
a
bland
diet
with
you
,
including
the
frequency
of
feeding
and
how
much
to
feed
at
each
sitting
.
You
should
ABSOLUTELY
call
your
veterinarian
back
immediately
to
clarify
anything
you
have
questions
about
.
They
have
seen
your
pet
,
and
are
most
aware
of
his
condition
.
No
one
online
will
be
able
to
assist
you
more
than
your
vet
can
.
You
need
to
ask
your
vet
these
questions
.
Boiled
WHITE
rice
and
boiled
chicken
breast
.
Bland
food
.
NO
SPICES
!
My
vet
told
me
when
a
dog
is
vomiting
a
lot
,
it
could
be
a
sign
of
obstruction
.
Did
they
do
any
x
-
rays
?
I
do
n't
know
if
vomiting
blood
is
common
with
this
ailment
.
You
should
call
your
vet
now
and
ask
them
what
is
normal
or
not
.
French
dating
etiquette
?
I
would
really
love
to
hear
what
the
French
or
those
who
had
dated
the
French
to
say
something
about
this
.
Coming
from
an
anglo
-
saxon
country
my
version
of
dating
is
'
getting
the
number
,
asking
her
out
,
etc.
.
'
However
,
I
've
read
on
the
internet
that
the
French
dating
etiquette
is
totally
different
.
For
them
,
dating
would
normally
be
meeting
in
groups
or
parties
,
then
pairing
off
.
They
are
also
very
secretive
about
being
in
a
relationship
.
They
only
'
go
out
in
the
open
'
once
they
have
reached
a
certain
level
of
seriousness
.
Is
it
true
?
I
have
told
a
French
girl
I
liked
her
,
and
she
accepted
.
She
is
friendly
when
we
see
each
other
on
campus
.
She
is
also
nicer
when
we
are
both
alone
.
However
,
when
we
are
at
parties
or
when
they
are
people
around
she
seems
to
ignore
me
.
She
also
seems
to
hate
it
whenever
I
ask
her
out
on
a
date
,
to
the
point
she
said
stop
!
My
mind
thinks
she
has
no
interest
in
me
and
just
stringing
me
along
.
But
the
articles
I
read
seemed
to
say
the
contrary
.
Have
I
just
fallen
victim
in
a
cultural
trap
?
What
you
have
read
in
the
internet
is
fairly
accurate
but
of
course
it
does
not
fit
all
scenarios
.
You
are
not
French
for
a
start
,
so
the
"
rules
"
or
"
customs
"
may
not
apply
to
you
when
it
comes
to
entering
into
a
relationship
between
people
from
different
backgrounds
.
From
what
you
say
the
messages
given
by
this
girl
are
quite
clear
.
She
is
not
stringing
you
along
since
she
is
actually
discouraging
you
and
is
honest
enough
to
tell
you
to
stop
asking
her
out
.
She
is
just
being
friendly
in
public
because
she
does
not
want
to
offend
you
and
she
treats
you
like
any
other
friend
.
You
said
you
liked
her
and
she
accepted
it
as
a
truth
and
perhaps
as
a
compliment
,
but
it
does
not
mean
she
fancies
you
or
wants
to
pair
off
with
you
.
At
parties
she
does
not
want
to
be
considered
in
any
way
attached
to
you
,
which
is
consistent
.
Take
the
messages
for
what
they
are
:
she
has
no
objection
in
you
being
pals
at
uni
,
but
she
does
not
want
to
take
matters
further
.
Non
!
means
"
non
"
,
not
"
I
might
consider
it
,
and
I
will
keep
you
attached
to
my
apron
strings
just
in
case
.
"
Christiane
gave
you
a
good
answer
.
You
have
fallen
in
a
cultural
misunderstanding
.
What
I
have
to
add
is
that
it
is
normal
in
France
to
have
mixed
gender
groups
of
friends
,
there
's
nothing
unusual
in
boys
and
girls
being
only
friends
,
which
is
obviously
what
this
girl
wants
from
you
.
She
probably
finds
your
company
pleasing
as
a
friend
but
you
are
not
her
choice
a
a
boyfriend
and
she
is
trying
to
keep
it
on
a
friendship
level
,
and
trying
to
make
you
understand
that
she
does
n't
want
to
go
further
.
If
she
is
nicer
when
you
are
alone
I
'd
say
it
is
because
in
public
view
she
is
making
sure
that
people
do
not
think
that
you
might
be
her
boyfriend
.
You
do
find
the
'
get
the
number
hop
in
bed
with
her
'
but
be
aware
that
they
usually
have
a
reputation
as
sluts
.
Unfair
for
the
girl
as
boys
do
n't
have
that
kind
of
handicap
,
but
that
's
the
way
our
own
rules
work
.
Should
have
done
research
before
you
left
.
Why
not
just
take
your
chances
and
do
it
your
way
?
True
or
false
:
being
a
young
New
Zealander
means
having
no
future
?
There
are
no
jobs
in
this
country
.
I
'm
just
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
whether
I
should
move
to
Australia
or
seek
work
in
the
sex
industry
.
Is
there
a
future
for
our
nation
's
youth
?
@
Ryan
B
,
I
'm
two
years
into
an
undergraduate
degree
.
Everybody
I
know
at
university
intends
to
stay
at
uni
for
as
long
as
possible
until
there
are
actually
jobs
available
.
Everybody
seems
to
flee
this
country
and
move
overseas
,
to
Australia
,
etc
.
There
's
obviously
a
reason
for
that
(
lack
of
employment
,
low
incomes
,
etc
.
)
Your
answer
does
n't
do
anything
but
remind
me
that
I
'm
going
to
be
$
25,000
in
debt
by
the
time
I
'm
22
.
So
,
thanks
.
@
W.a.b.b.y
,
I
really
like
you're
answer
.
it
's
very
logical
.
I
've
also
considered
becoming
a
teacher
,
but
it
's
not
a
job
I
'm
cut
out
for
.
I
also
wish
I
'd
applied
for
a
scholarship
.
Obviously
I
'm
still
completely
stupid
though
.
I
mean
,
I
was
n't
smart
enough
to
apply
for
a
scholarship
.
And
yes
,
I
am
being
melodramatic
.
Lol

@

So
I
would
n't
make
a
good
prostitute
?
Are
you
saying
I
'm
bad
in
bed
?
How
would
you
know
?
Joking
.
Your
answer
is
very
sweet
,
but
I
'm
not
compassionate
towards
teenage
high
school
students
.
In
my
opinion
,
far
too
many
people
are
at
university
studying
worthless
degrees
.
Yes
things
like
philosophy
and
fashion
design
are
interesting
,
but
how
many
jobs
are
out
there
for
someone
with
these
qualifications
?
I
'm
studying
to
be
a
teacher
,
so
I
know
that
there
will
definitely
be
jobs
out
there
when
I
'm
done
.
I
may
have
to
live
somewhere
rural
or
in
Auckland
,
but
at
least
I
can
be
pretty
sure
I
'll
be
employable
.
I
've
also
got
a
bachelor
s
degree
so
I
can
go
back
and
do
further
study
or
take
a
different
profession
.
I
also
know
that
you
do
n't
get
paid
that
much
more
in
Australia
than
you
do
here
.
And
it
's
not
all
about
how
much
you
earn
,
cost
of
living
is
much
higher
in
many
cities
in
Australia
.
Try
living
in
Sydney
on
a
teacher
's
salary
,
then
compare
it
to
somewhere
like
Central
Otago
.
You
also
have
to
put
up
with
all
the
annoying
accents
in
Australia
.
It
's
probably
not
a
wise
idea
to
keep
studying
and
having
a
massive
student
loan
.
At
the
moment
there
's
no
interest
,
but
that
'll
probably
change
.
And
they
'll
probably
add
interest
to
what
you
've
already
racked
up
.
And
they
're
working
towards
being
able
to
extradite
people
who
have
left
the
country
to
avoid
paying
it
back
.
At
the
moment
if
you
move
overseas
you
can
only
come
back
to
New
Zealand
for
a
short
amount
of
time
before
they
'll
force
you
cough
up
.
And
all
that
time
you
're
overseas
you
'll
be
racking
up
interest
.
I
would
n't
like
not
having
the
option
to
return
to
NZ
.
I
guess
I
'm
extremely
fortunate
that
I
received
a
scholarship
which
paid
about
800
f
my
course
fees
through
my
degree
.
But
I
worked
hard
and
I
'm
still
working
hard
.
There
are
far
too
many
lazy
people
out
there
who
think
that
they
can
sit
around
a
job
will
fall
in
their
lap
.

People
have
been
fleeing
this
country
at
roughly
a
plane
load
per
week
for
the
past
20
+
years
,
so
it
's
not
anything
new
.
It
depends
on
what
you
hunger

why
does
my
baby
king
snake
refuse
to
eat
?
i
have
a
baby
eastern
king
snake
.
i
have
tried
EVERYTHING
i
can
to
get
him
to
eat
but
he
refuses
.
he
has
a
great
environment
,
with
water
and
lots
of
hiding
places
and
a
heat
lamp
.
as
far
as
i
know
,
everything
is
as
good
as
it
can
be
where
his
aquarium
is
concerned
.
according
to
the
vet
,
he
is
healthy
and
looks
good
.
he
has
been
going
to
the
bathroom
like
he
should
.
(
i
know
that
snakes
that
have
problems
going
to
the
bathroom
wo
n't
eat
.
)
he
has
been
drinking
water
(
i
am
pretty
sure
he
has
been
drinking
it
out
of
his
bowl
,
but
also
i
have
been
feeding
him
water
and
he
does
n't
ever
give
me
a
problem
with
that
-
i
just
stick
his
head
near
the
water
and
he
sucks
it
down
.
)
i
handle
him
every
few
days
.
he
is
feisty
,
as
most
king
snakes
are
,
but
he
is
a
very
nice
little
guy
-
he
never
tries
to
bite
or
anything
.
i
just
love
him
to
death
.
i
do
n't
know
why
he
wo
n't
eat
though
!
i
have
tried
feeding
him
5
or
6
live
pinkies
and
4
or
5
frozen
(
thawed
)
pinkies
.
i
have
never
tried
feeding
him
a
pinky
that
was
bigger
around
than
he
is
.
i
have
tried
putting
him
in
a
small
container
and
putting
him
in
a
dark
place
for
an
hour
or
so
and
he
wo
n't
touch
the
pinky
.
he
crawls
on
top
of
them
but
does
not
try
to
eat
them
.
he
does
n't
seem
to
know
that
they
are
food
.
i
have
tried
"
braining
"
both
live
and
dead
pinkies
,
and
bloodying
them
up
to
get
his
attention
,
but
he
does
n't
care
.
i
have
tried
dipping
both
live
and
thawed
pinkies
in
tuna
juice
,
and
in
used
gerbil
bedding
.
i
have
bought
some
long
reptile
feeding
tweezers
and
have
tried
holding
the
pinky
in
front
of
the
snake
's
face
.
he
wo
nt
even
try
to
bite
.
i
am
very
discouraged
and
sad
and
i
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
he
has
n't
eaten
in
an
entire
month
.
i
've
only
tried
to
feed
him
one
at
a
time
.
he
's
just
a
tiny
baby
,
about
the
width
of
a
pencil
.
do
babies
this
small
hibernate
?
When
you
feed
him
how
many
pinkies
do
you
feed
him
?
If
you
feed
him
too
many
he
could
just
not
be
hungry
.
If
he
does
n't
seem
interested
in
them
at
all
I
would
say
he
's
just
not
hungry
.
My
boyfriend
has
one
and
when
she
's
hungry
she
attacks
the
pinkie
right
away
.
They
can
smell
it
so
i
'm
sure
he
knows
what
it
is
and
just
do
n't
want
it
.
Remember
snakes
can
go
a
while
without
eating
.
In
the
winter
,
they
will
usually
go
deep
underground
and
enter
a
hibernation
-
like
state
called
brumation
,
which
is
characterized
by
a
slowed
metabolism
and
reduced
activity
.
King
snakes
sometimes
stop
eating
,
particularly
during
the
cooler
part
of
the
year
.
They
have
a
natural
instinct
to
hibernate
.
If
the
snake
is
not
pregnant
or
shedding
,
and
its
enclosure
is
properly
equipped
,
a
loss
of
appetite
probably
signals
a
beginning
of
hibernation
.
Hibernation
is
natural
,
and
a
necessity
for
snakes
that
are
going
to
be
bred
.
Another
thing
that
can
cause
a
king
snake
to
stop
eating
is
shedding
.
You
can
tell
when
your
king
snake
is
about
to
shed
,
because
its
eyes
will
get
milky
looking
.
Its
body
will
be
dull
looking
,
too
.
In
a
few
days
the
snake
will
begin
to
shed
its
skin
.
For
example
,
some
snakes
will
routinely
go
off
their
food
in
both
the
summer
and
winter
,
feeding
mainly
in
spring
and
fall
.
It
's
natural
and
so
long
as
you
do
n't
see
any
serious
deterioration
in
their
health
is
nothing
to
worry
about
.
You
see
,
some
snakes
for
no
obvious
reason
will
simply
go
off
their
food
.
They
're
fit
and
healthy
and
their
care
is
suitable
.
hope
this
helped
.
That
's
why
it
's
good
to
have
a
python
!
It
's
twice
my
size
and
eats
a
rabbit
once
a
month
.
are
my
two
cats
fighting
or
playing
?
how
rough
is
too
rough
?
help
!?
i
have
a
1
and
a
half
year
old
male
neutered
cat
and
a
new
2
month
old
spayed
female
kitten
.
the
first
night
i
brought
her
home
i
did
the
sniffing
under
the
door
thing
and
left
it
at
that
.
the
next
day
i
let
her
out
of
the
bedroom
so
they
could
check
each
other
out
,
and
the
kitten
hissed
twice
within
the
first
20
minutes
of
meeting
each
other
and
now
she
no
longer
hisses
and
they
have
been
playing
(
chasing
each
other
up
and
down
the
hall
,
rolling
around
on
the
ground
and
pawing
at
each
other
)
.
only
once
it
looked
like
my
male
cat
was
biting
at
her
neck
and
then
her
stomach
and
she
was
meowing
fairly
loud
and
hissed
once
then
he
backed
off
and
now
they
are
fine
.
were
they
roughhouse
playing
?
or
were
they
actually
fighting
?
he
has
been
"
biting
"
at
her
neck
and
stomach
previously
while
they
play
without
her
meowing
or
anything
so
i
m
wondering
if
he
went
a
little
to
far
that
one
time
.
any
answers
help
!!!!!!
you
did
not
leave
the
new
kitten
in
the
room
long
enough
.
you
need
to
do
that
for
a
least
a
week
,
or
else
this
type
of
territorial
fighting
will
happen
.
giving
the
new
kitten
her
own
small
territory
will
help
her
to
feel
safe
and
will
give
her
a
place
to
go
to
when
scared
.
right
now
,
your
male
is
fighting
off
an
intruder
,
and
he
feels
that
all
of
the
house
is
his
.
put
her
back
in
the
room
,
and
keep
the
door
closed
for
a
week
.
then
let
her
out
for
ten
minutes
.
make
it
fifteen
the
next
day
,
then
twenty
,
and
so
on
.
this
will
do
two
things
;
the
new
kitten
will
rub
her
cheek
on
the
furniture
in
her
room
,
making
it
her
territory
.
she
will
start
to
calm
down
and
feel
safe
-
you
can
bet
she
does
n't
now
.
she
knows
she
is
invading
someone
else
's
territory
,
but
ca
n't
help
it
,
and
has
no
where
to
go
.
she
will
be
able
to
sleep
without
being
afraid
.
as
well
,
your
male
will
be
able
to
see
that
his
territory
is
not
threatened
.
when
the
door
opens
,
he
will
get
that
the
one
room
is
hers
,
and
he
will
be
OK
with
that
.
the
territory
thing
will
be
solved
.
your
male
is
hurting
her
to
put
her
in
her
place
-
biting
her
scruff
is
dominance
and
biting
the
belly
is
a
move
cats
use
when
hunting
-
to
pull
the
guts
out
of
their
prey
.
this
is
not
good
.
give
them
time
to
set
up
their
territories
,
and
once
you
bring
the
new
kitten
out
,
pay
a
lot
of
attention
to
the
male
.
you
have
brought
someone
else
into
his
territory
,
and
he
needs
to
be
reminded
that
you
still
love
him
,
and
support
his
claim
to
his
space
.
that
will
help
to
reassure
him
,
and
he
will
be
less
aggressive
with
her
.
when
they
play
fight
,
they
do
n't
hiss
.
if
they
hiss
,
they
are
not
playing
.
if
they
bite
,
and
one
cries
,
you
must
separate
them
,
and
you
must
keep
an
eye
on
them
.
hissing
is
OK
,
unless
they
start
to
fight
.
if
that
happens
,
separate
them
,
and
give
them
time
apart
.
putting
the
girl
in
her
territory
will
make
her
feel
less
afraid
,
and
she
will
relax
.
good
luck
!
It
means
they
've
gone
too
far
.
When
they
start
bleeding
that
means
they
're
really
fighting
.
If
they
're
going
kinda
slow
and
like
fake
biting
(
not
biting
as
hard
as
they
can
)
,
and
fake
scratching
(
not
hitting
as
hard
as
they
can
with
their
paws
)
then
they
're
playing
.
I
have
two
cats
,
and
at
first
they
hissed
at
each
other
because
cats
are
very
territorial
,
but
now
they
do
fight
and
play
.
The
difference
is
when
the
cat
hisses
,
that
means
they
are
annoyed
and
they
want
the
other
cat
to
go
away
.
That
means
they
are
fighting
.
When
they
are
just
jumping
at
each
other
and
their
tails
are
wagging
that
means
that
they
are
playing
.
I
can
see
how
you
get
confused
though
.

What
was
the
goal
for
North
Vietnam
in
the
Tet
offensive
?
When
Johnson
deployed
troops
in
1964
he
was
advised
by
the
military
it
would
take
a
half
-
million
troops
about
ten
years
to
pacify
South
Vietnam
.
He
refused
to
believe
them
and
ordered
the
military
to
win
the
war
within
two
to
three
years
(
before
the
next
election
in
1968
)
.
He
did
not
give
them
the
number
of
troops
they
requested
.
This
left
Westmoreland
with
few
options
,
so
he
adapted
a
Search
and
Destroy
strategy
instead
of
a
Clear
and
Defend
strategy
which
is
,
in
the
long
run
,
the
preferred
method
of
pacifying
an
insurgency
.
Thing
is
,
it
worked
.
The
ARVN
was
not
having
a
big
problem
with
the
Local
VC
(
the
guerilla
movement
)
,
they
were
being
challenged
by
the
Main
Force
VC
(
which
was
light
infantry
)
and
the
North
Vietnamese
Army
(
NVA
)
.
However
,
Johnson
would
not
let
the
military
cross
the
borders
and
clean
out
the
Communist
bases
.
He
was
warned
that
they
were
building
up
a
huge
Army
and
would
eventually
launch
an
attack
,
but
he
ignored
his
military
advisers
.
They
could
not
defeat
the
Americans
.
THAT
WAS
THE
PLAN
.
What
happened
?
The
ARVN
rushed
back
from
holiday
leave
and
counterattacked
.
The
government
did
NOT
fall
.
And
the
South
Vietnamese
people
?
When
give
the
ultimate
choice
,
they
rallied
â€¦
TO
THE
SOUTH
VIETNAMESE
GOVERNMENT
â€¦.
They
were
chased
back
into
Laos
and
Cambodia
with
the
ARVN
in
hot
pursuit
.
The
people
rejected
their
attempt
to
topple
the
government
,
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
US
military
(
and
the
ARVN
)
handed
Johnson
the
victory
he
had
ordered
them
to
achieve
within
the
time
-
frame
he
ordered
it
.
All
he
had
to
do
for
a
complete
victory
was
allow
the
military
to
go
into
Laos
and
Cambodia
and
finish
off
the
shattered
Communist
forces
.
But
Johnson
was
so
obtuse
he
did
nâ€™t
understand
he
had
a
victory
when
it
was
handed
to
him
on
a
silver
platter
.
Instead
he
pulled
the
military
off
,
stopped
the
bombing
of
North
Vietnam
,
withdrew
from
the
presidential
race
,
and
spent
the
rest
of
his
term
in
office
trying
to
surrender
to
North
Vietnam
.
They
screwed
up
by
not
accepting
his
surrender
when
he
offered
it
.
The
American
people
were
NOT
having
any
of
it
,
and
elected
Richard
Nixon
to
fix
the
mess
LBJ
had
made
(
not
to
surrender
like
the
antiwar
movement
was
demanding
)
.
In
the
end
Nixon
kept
his
promise
for
â€œ
â€¦
peace
with
honor
â€¦.
â€
But
that
â€™s
another
question
.
To
emancipate
the
south
,
but
it
was
a
serious
failure
.
To
make
the
war
unpalatable
to
the
American
public
.
In
that
,
they
pretty
much
succeeded
.
Tet
made
it
clear
that
the
war
was
a
long
way
from
being
over
if
the
Americans
thought
they
could
preserve
the
South
and
that
the
North
was
perfectly
willing
to
suffer
great
losses
to
continue
their
fight
.
There
is
a
very
good
book
on
the
subject
that
was
written
by
General
Vo
Nguyen
Giap

Bearded
dragon
question
...
?
I
just
bought
a
baby
one
yesterday
.
I
have
a
basking
spot
lamp
that
says
it
is
a
double
reflector
that
focuses
35
%
more
light
/
heat
and
provides
beneficial
UVA
rays
important
to
the
psycholical
well
-
being
of
him
.
My
question
is
does
that
mean
it
gives
him
not
only
the
heat
,
but
the
"
sun
rays
"
he
needs
?
I
also
was
wondering
how
long
should
this
light
be
on
.
He
's
getting
used
to
his
new
home
,
but
has
n't
eatin
yet
.
I
have
bearded
dragon
juvenile
food
and
freeze
-
dried
crickets
.
Any
advice
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
Thank
you
for
your
time
.
Let
me
try
to
break
this
down
as
simply
as
I
can
:
diurnal
(
active
during
the
day
time
)
reptiles
like
the
bearded
dragon
require
3
types
of
"
light
,
"
UVA
,
UVB
,
and
heat
.
Any
white
light
emitting
light
source
will
emit
UVA
,
including
heat
bulbs
,
that
's
the
easy
one
to
provide
for
.
UVB
on
the
other
hand
can
only
be
reproduced
by
a
fluorescent
source
.
UVB
will
always
be
a
separate
bulb
from
the
heat
lamp
,
unless
you
use
a
MVB
(
mercury
vapor
bulb
)
which
is
the
only
reptile
use
bulb
that
will
emit
both
UVB
and
heat
from
one
bulb
.
I
highly
recommend
that
you
do
not
use
coiled
/
compact
UVB
bulbs
as
they
are
known
to
cause
severe
eye
damage
and
/
or
blindness
in
reptiles
not
to
mention
they
have
trouble
maintaining
UVB
output
over
time
.
So
,
to
answer
your
question
,
no
,
if
you
just
have
a
bulb
that
says
it
produces
UVA
then
you
do
not
have
"
the
sun
's
rays
"
that
your
bearded
needs
.
You
need
to
also
provide
a
source
a
UVB
lighting
.
Freeze
dried
food
is
not
a
good
staple
food
source
;
you
need
to
offer
live
feeder
insects
.
Live
food
is
also
higher
in
nutritional
value
than
freeze
dried
.
Wax
worms
and
meal
worms
should
only
be
offered
as
treat
items
,
for
variety
's
sake
.
I
would
highly
recommend
that
you
read
through
some
reliable
bearded
guides
to
make
sure
you
have
everything
set
up
correctly
:
mm
it
depends
on
the
size
of
his
tank
or
cage
or
whatever
you
have
him
in
..
at
least
as
far
as
i
'm
concerned
.
That
lady
at
PetSmart
is
a
disgrace
to
the
rest
of
us
PetSmart
associates
...
sheesh
.
Yes
,
it
gives
him
the
"
sun
rays
"
necessary
,
that
's
what
UVA
is
.
As
for
the
heat
,
just
be
sure
to
use
a
thermometer
.
I
tell
all
my
customers
they
can
try
it
,
but
do
n't
count
on
it
.
Please
help
me
!
Hi
there
,
Please
choose
the
parakeet
...
Here
s
my
reason
.....
I
did
the
same
thing
that
you
did
for
christmas
.
I
ended
up
getting
a
pair
of
zebra
finches
for
christmas
.
At
first
it
was
all
cool
and
all
.
They
were
chirping
and
doing
their
every
day
business
.
After
a
couple
of
weeks
I
got
tired
of
them
.
They
are
quite
messy
and
you
can
not
hold
or
pet
them
.
I
ve
tried
to
tame
them
and
they
just
would
not
get
tamed
.
They
do
nt
want
to
be
held
or
touched
.
I
want
a
bird
that
I
can
hold
and
do
tricks
.
I
still
have
them
and
they
are
doing
well
.
A
couple
of
months
after
I
got
parakeets
/
budgies
.
They
are
adorable
they
have
beautiful
colors
and
personality
.
I
love
them
.
First
of
all
they
are
very
tame
.
I
tamed
them
in
4
days
.
They
can
do
tricks
and
they
are
nt
messy
.
The
whole
family
loves
them
.
My
parents
even
plays
with
them
.
They
are
a
big
part
of
our
family
.
I
hope
this
helps
you
with
your
decision
.
They
are
both
about
the
same
noise
level
.
When
choosing
a
parakeet
look
for
a
young
one
.
Look
for
a
lot
of
stripes
in
their
head
that
starts
from
the
beak
and
goes
back
to
the
back
fo
the
bird
.
(
think
of
a
balding
man
lol
)
Look
for
clean
feathers
.
If
you
want
a
boy
the
cere
(
the
nostrils
piece
above
the
beak
)
must
be
blue
.
The
girl
has
either
pink
or
brown
.
I
would
recommend
that
you
get
two
parakeets
.
But
get
either
one
male
and
one
female
,
or
two
males
.
Do
not
get
two
females
.
They
sometimes
do
nt
get
along
(
you
know
how
some
girls
are
lol
hahahaahh
but
for
real
though
,
two
girls
tend
to
fight
a
lot
.
I
have
one
yellow
girl
and
a
green
and
yellow
boy
.
If
you
choose
to
get
a
parakeet
this
is
a
trick
that
I
used
to
tame
them
.
However
if
you
plan
on
getting
one
,
then
get
more
than
one
at
the
same
time
they
need
company
.
My
mom
told
me
how
to
tame
them
and
I
was
very
happy
with
the
results
.
It
took
me
4
days
to
get
the
new
one
to
be
able
to
step
on
and
eat
out
of
my
hand
.
These
are
the
steps
I
used
.
Honestly
they
have
worked
for
me
twice
with
my
parakeets
.
Hopefully
they
will
work
for
you
.

)
When
you
get
the
bird
,
place
him
or
her
or
them
in
the
cage
.
2
)
Then
place
you
hand
in
the
cage
.
I
took
the
cage
and
place
it
next
to
the
couch
.
Then
I
sat
on
the
couch
,
placed
one
hand
in
the
cage
,
holding
a
millet
spray
.
(
this
way
the
will
associate
your
hand
with
food
,
and
birds
love
food
lol
)
Then
I
turned
on
the
tv
and
watch
.
This
way
they
will
see
that
your
hand
is
good
and
it
s
not
going
to
grab
them
or
hurt
them
.
Do
this
for
about
one
hour
.

)
After
about
day
2
,
they
will
start
to
eating
the
millet
spray
from
your
hand
.
(
do
not
take
away
the
food
dish
from
the
birds
,
they
will
associate
you
as
the
person
who
takes
away
their
food
)
....
Then
take
your
finger
and
place
it
under
their
belly
,
in
front
of
their
feet
and
say
up
.
(
the
first
couple
of
times
they
will
fly
all
over
the
cage
but
as
long
as
you
do
nt
jump
back
or
screem
they
will
get
used
to
you
)
They
will
have
no
choice
but
to
go
on
your
finger
.
When
they
see
that
you
ar
nt
harming
them
,
the
will
go
up
on
your
finger
when
you
say
up
.

)
If
they
are
not
going
up
by
now
you
just
got
ta
keep
trying
and
keep
trying
.
Do
not
hit
,
yell
,
or
harm
them
.
You
have
patience
.
Do
nt
give
up
!
After
a
couple
of
weeks
mines
knows
when
I
say
shoulder
it
means
ot
go
on
my
sholder
,
when
I
say
up
it
means
to
jump
up
on
my
finger
,
when
I
say
up
and
out
it
means
up
on
my
finger
and
out
of
the
cage
.
and
when
I
say
go
home
it
means
to
go
in
the
cage
.
Good
luck
!
They
worked
for
me
and
I
hope
they
worked
for
you
!
They
are
awesome
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And
that
s
my
reason
why
you
should
choose
a
parakeet
over
a
finch
.
Parakeet
.
They
are
normally
quiet
and
it
is
easy
to
take
care
of
them
.
They
are
also
friendly
.
I
have
a
parakeet
named
Cookie
.
:P
My
sister
and
I
would
like
to
go
to
Ireland
.
I
graduate
in
the
spring
,
and
so
we
'd
like
to
go
between
then
and
winter
.
We
do
n't
want
too
many
tourists
,
and
since
we
'll
both
be
out
of
school
we
can
go
anytime
between
the
middle
of
June
to
early
November
.
We
do
n't
want
it
to
be
too
cold
(
not
sure
when
exactly
there
fall
is
...
or
what
the
weather
is
really
like
there
during
our
autumn
months
)
,
but
we
do
n't
feel
like
we
need
to
go
right
in
the
middle
of
summer
either
.
People
do
not
go
to
Ireland
on
holiday
for
the
weather
,
it
is
unpredictable
.
One
thing
you
can
be
sure
of
about
Irish
weather
is
how
little
you
can
be
sure
of
.
It
may
be
shirtsleeves
and
sunglasses
in
February
,
but
winter
woollies
in
March
and
even
during
the
summer
.
And
then
there
â€™s
the
rain
.
County
Kerry
is
the
worst
affected
.
The
Irish
weather
works
on
the
â€˜
four
seasons
in
a
day
â€™
principle
,
which
basicÂ­ally
means
that
you
ca
nâ€™t
predict
a
thing
when
it
comes
to
the
behaviour
of
the
sky
.
Some
basic
assumptions
,
however
,
can
be
made
.
In
summer
,
from
May
to
July
,
the
days
are
reasonably
warm
and
â€“
most
importantly
â€“
very
long
:
at
the
height
of
summer
you
wo
nâ€™t
need
to
turn
on
lights
until
after
10
pm
.
It
is
also
peak
tourist
season
,
which
means
there
are
far
more
people
just
about
everywhere
but
the
most
remote
corners
of
the
island
,
and
prices
are
at
their
highest
.
Not
surprisingly
,
most
of
the
yearly
festivals
occur
during
these
times
so
as
to
take
advantage
of
the
crowds
and
the
more
favourable
weather
.
Spring
(
February
to
April
)
and
Autumn
(
August
to
October
)
make
good
alternatives
,
although
the
country
â€™s
ever
-
growing
popularity
as
a
tourist
destination
can
often
blur
the
lines
between
mid
-
and
high
-
season
tourism
.
Spring
festivities
include
the
ever
-
popular
St
Patrick
â€™s
Festival
.
Although
temperatures
do
not
often
venture
below
freezing
,
winter
(
December
to
February
)
can
be
brutal
,
for
huge
parts
of
the
country
â€“
the
west
and
northwest
in
particular
.
The
thing
to
do
is
to
bring
the
right
clothing
with
you
,
clothes
so
you
can
layer
up
if
it
is
cold
and
take
off
layers
when
it
warms
up
.
Waterproof
clothing
and
footwear
are
essential
plus
an
umbrella
..
As
that
famous
Scotsman
Billy
Connolly
says
"
there
is
no
such
thing
as
bad
weather
just
the
wrong
clothes
"
Afraid
I
can
not
be
more
helpful
,
it
is
really
a
case
of
pot
luck
,
although
as
the
weather
is
so
changeable
often
a
cold
wet
morning
will
turn
into
a
lovely
warm
sunny
afternoon
and
evening
or
visa
versa
.
If
you
mean
the
Republic
of
Ireland
(
Dublin
)
then
anytime
.
The
summer
there
is
much
more
mild
than
most
of
the
US
(
are
you
coming
from
the
US
?
)
.
Their
seasons
are
the
same
as
all
the
countries
in
the
Northern
Hemisphere
but
I
would
suggest
fall
.
September
for
example
.
Rent
a
car
and
spend
a
couple
days
outside
of
Dublin
seeing
the
countryside
and
you
will
have
the
trip
of
a
lifetime
.
We
only
had
a
few
sunny
days
this
summer
,
barely
24
C
on
a
few
occasions
,
more
like
14
C
most
days
.
We
used
our
BBQ
on
precisely
4
occasions
.
Autumn
is
from
mid
August
onwards
as
far
as
the
weather
goes
if
not
officially
according
to
the
calender
.
The
days
start
to
shorten
&
it
gets
even
wetter
,
windier
&
colder
.
You
do
realise
it
is
quite
expensive
to
visit
Ireland
?
You
are
going
to
need
a
few
thousand
dollars
saved
up
for
flights
,
insurance
,
food
,
accommodation
&
spending
money
.
Eating
out
in
particular
is
quite
expensive
compared
to
America
I
believe
.
Golden
Wonder
KilliFish
Breeding
Help
?
I
have
4
Golden
Wonder
Killifish
.
1
of
them
is
really
colorful
and
is
about
6
cm
long
.
2
of
them
are
kinda
whitish
and
are
about
4
-
5
cm
long
.
The
last
one
is
colourful
too
but
it
is
about
4
cm
long
.
I
feed
them
Flakes
,
and
Live
Earthworms
uncut
everyday
.
Can
you
tell
me
the
whole
process
of
breeding
them
and
taking
care
of
the
babies
?
Thanks
in
Advance
.
Wow
!
If
they
are
able
to
take
earthworms
uncut
,
that
is
really
impressive
!
I
aspire
to
your
feeding
regime
,
flakes
early
and
something
live
later
in
the
day
.
Worms
(
and
Daphnia
)
are
also
rich
in
Lipids
,
substances
important
in
forming
eggs
and
growing
young
.
I
think
that
you
understand
that
your
largest
and
smallest
golden
wonders
are
males
.
If
you
would
like
more
on
sexing
out
Aplocheilus
lineatus
take
a
look
at
the
discussion
in
the
first
source
below
.
If
you
have
plants
in
your
tank
.
your
lineatus
are
already
spawning
.
If
conditions
are
favorable
(
78
-
82
F
)
and
the
fish
are
obviously
well
fed
as
yours
are
,
they
will
spawn
.
If
you
wish
to
pick
eggs
make
a
acrylic
spawning
mop
.
Check
out
the
second
source
.
I
prefer
darker
colors
because
I
can
see
their
eggs
,
more
easily
and
the
fish
look
better
next
to
them
.
Use
a
well
rinsed
medicine
vial
,
a
cork
,
new
fishing
bobber
or
even
a
piece
of
non-crumbly
styrofoam
to
float
them
.
There
are
a
couple
ways
one
could
spawn
lineatus
-
mop
spawning
&
water
incubating
them
for
two
weeks
,
picking
eggs
from
a
mop
&
putting
them
in
a
tray
of
treated
,
seasoned
water
or
setting
up
the
parents
in
a
planted
tank
&
moving
them
so
the
fry
can
hatch
out
there
.
Just
making
up
examples
,
but
if
a
pair
is
constantly
together
,
they
may
lay
10
-
15
eggs
a
day
.
Separated
and
feed
extremely
nourishing
stuff
,
they
may
produce
more
.
They
also
start
the
day
with
no
nicks
or
dings
in
their
fins
.
The
water
changes
help
with
that
too
.
You
also
may
need
to
treat
the
incubation
water
.
The
chlorine
and
ammonia
(
choramine
)
are
not
good
for
the
eggs
.
Ironically
sometimes
it
is
wise
to
leave
the
newly
picked
eggs
in
fresh
tap
water
with
some
chlorination
to
kill
microscopic
critters
that
ride
in
with
the
eggs
.
THEN
put
the
eggs
in
water
treated
a
couple
of
days
before
with
a
water
treatment
and
left
open
to
"
breathe
"
.
Leaving
a
jar
with
a
dozen
black
worms
in
it
will
sate
the
adult
's
desire
for
snacks
and
they
are
more
likely
to
leave
fry
or
eggs
alone
.
If
a
pair
is
n't
leaving
eggs
...
check
the
following
:
1
.
Is
a
tank
mate
(
such
as
another
female
killie
or
a
Cory
or
large
snails
)
rating
the
eggs
?
2
.
Have
we
kept
up
with
partial
water
changes
?
3
.
Is
there
too
much
mineral
in
the
water
?
Aplo.
lineatus
are
wide
-
spread
over
southern
India
.
That
indicates
that
they
thrive
in
different
water
chemistries
.
TDS
meters
(
the
thrifty
aquarist
's
hardness
meter
can
be
used
if
one
has
seen
one
of
your
municipal
water
department
's
annual
reports
.
They
include
a
number
of
minerals
there
and
you
can
figure
out
what
percentage
of
that
would
be
your
hardness
minerals
(
calcium
,
magnesium
and
iron
)
.
A
number
of
minerals
are
not
of
much
consequence
.
However
if
there
is
a
high
level
of
sodium
chloride
(
common
salt
)
that
can
break
down
the
chorion
(
shell
)
around
the
egg
and
allow
critters
to
get
in
and
eat
the
yoke
and
embryo
.
)
Ironically
sometimes
it
is
wise
to
newly
picked
eggs
in
fresh
tap
water
with
some
chlorination
to
kill
microscopic
critters
that
ride

.
THEN
put
the
eggs
in
water
treated
a
couple
of

before
with
a
water
treatment
and
left
open

"

"
.
If
you
get
eggs
in
the
mail
in
a
medicine
vial
,
that
is
fine
.
But
get
the
eggs
out
,
maybe
rinsed
in
fresh
tap
water
and
then
into
the
incubation
water
.
In
time
the
eggs
can
suffocate
in
the
shipping
container
.
Another
problem
is
that
sometimes
bad
eggs
will
fungus
and
the
fungus
will
spread
out
and
kill
all
the
eggs
.
Some
people
put
in
a
very
dilute
Acriflaven
solution
to
slow
down
the
fungus
,
so
one
can
take
white
eggs
out
with
a
pipette
or
eyedropper
.
Other
will
add
a
drop
of
Methylene
blue
.
If
an
egg
turns
blue
,
it
had
died
and
then
became
dyed
as
the
outer
membrane
broke
down
.
Get
those
out
ASAP
too
.
Hope
there
is
useful
grist
for
the
mill
here

Disney
cruise
line
with
young
ones

Should
I
get
a
balcony
?
Any
tips
or
advice
to
make

experience
??
Thanks
!!!
It
is
vacation
time
.
They
look
for
fun
filled
,
rejuvenating
and
memorable
vacation
.
There
can
be
many
ideas
;
one
can
see
numerous
options
passing
through
their
mind
.
Disney
cruises
,
is
a
simple
answer
to
this
.
From
1998
onwards
,
from
its
inception
Disney
cruise
has
attracted
many
and
continue
to
attract
more
and
more
.
This
is
a
spectacular
ship
,
a
very
popular
choice
of
families
to
spend
their
leisure
time
.
The
ship
is
designed
thematically
,
with
imposing
animated
cartoon
characters
.
Do
you
feel
that
the
holidaying
with
the
animated
cartoons
will
impress
only
young
ones
?
Whatever
be
the
age
,
you
will
have
the
choice
of
variety
of
activities
to
forget
about
your
hectic
day
-
to
-
day
activities
.
There
are
two
ships
,
Disney
magic
and
Disney
wonder
.
Both
are
made
keeping
in
mind
the
comforts
of
the
travelers
.
Disney
cruises
offer
24
-
hour
room
services
,
and
the
crews
are
ready
to
serve
you
the
way
you
like
.
It
has
got
very
spacious
rooms
,
furnished
completely
and
neatly
.
These
are
decorated
uniquely
and
marvelously
.
The
ship
offers
variety
of
eatables
,
deliciously
made
.
Sea
fishes
,
prawns
and
many
nice
options
are
there
in
different
restaurants
aboard
.
There
are
many
good
options
of
delicious
food
on
the
shores
as
well
.
It
is
really
an
entertainment
for
the
kids
.
There
are
other
amnesties
also
.
Also
one
can
keep
their
privacy
in
the
cabins
and
make
the
time
in
seclusion
.
There
are
many
online
sites
offering
the
booking
facility
with
affordable
rates
.
You
can
select
the
proper
route
and
travel
plans
by
consulting
the
agents
prior
to
the
booking
........
Off
season
is
good
,
however
,
the
Disney
cruises
are
almost
ALWAYS
completely
booked
.
I
would
suggest
a
warmer
season
,
but
not
Spring
Break
or
early
summer
.
You
may
also
want
to
avoid
Thanksgiving
week
and
the
Christmas
holidays
.
With
young
ones
,
I
would
definitely
get
a
window
or
view
room
so
they
can
see
outside
.
Check
out
the
kids
'
space
as
soon
as
you
get
onboard
.
Do
NOT
feel
guilty
about
taking
them
there
.
They
have
a
BLAST
so
the
sooner
they
get
there
,
the
sooner
they
can
have
fun
.
We
liked
getting
the
late
dinner
seating
,
so
you
have
more
time
to
see
movies
and
stuff
but
if
your
kids
are
'
early
to
bed
'
you
may
want
the
earlier
seating
for
dinners
.
Bring
some
sort
of
magnet
or
small
magnetic
whiteboard
for
your
door
.
All
of
the
doors
tend
to
look
alike
and
having
'
something
'
on
your
door
helps
you
and
your
kids
find
your
room
easier
.
You
can
also
leave
notes
for
the
rest
of
your
family
(
husband
)
about
where
you
are
at
any
given
point
.
Cell
phones
do
NOT
work
on
board
but
they
give
you
a
'
walkie
-
talkie
'
kind
of
phone
in
your
room
that
WILL
work
onboard
.
Each
evening
you
will
get
a
'
magazine
'
called
The
Navigator
which
lists
all
of
the
activities
for
the
next
day
.
We
always
took
ours
to
dinner
and
discussed
what
things
we
felt
we
'
had
'
to
do
and
which
ones
we
felt
like
skipping
in
lieu
of
just
chilling
.
Any
time
would
be
great
.
We
had
a
ball
.
We
had
an
inside
cabin
and
it
is
what
I
would
recommend
.
There
are
so
many
things
to
do
that
you
will
only
use
your
room
for
sleeping
and
the
extra
cost
of
the
balcony
is
wasted
.
The
range
of
activities
can
be
illustrated
by
describing
the
water
activities
.
There
is
a
splash
fountain
(
no
standing
water
)
for
little
ones
still
in
diapers
;
Next
is
a
wading
pool
for
those
who
are
potty
trained
;
Then
a
family
pool
;
Finally
there
is
a
pool
for
adults
only
with
kids
not
allowed
.
You
will
never
be
so
spoiled
in
your
life
as
you
are
on
a
Disney
Cruise
.
If
you
stay
with
your
dining
schedule
,
every
night
is
dinner
and
a
show
.
The
real
payoff
is
that
you
will
have
the
same
waiter
for
the
entire
cruise
.
Since
they
knew
our
preferences
,
we
almost
always
went
along
with
their
menu
suggestions
and
were
never
sorry
we
did
.
Obviously
they
had
a
full
beverage
list
including
alcohol
for
adults
who
wanted
it
.
If
you
should
miss
a
meal
,
you
also
missed
a
great
show
.
but
food
is
always
available
and
it
is
consistently
good
.
I
think
I
gained
three
pounds
in
my
week
long
cruise
.
This
is
about
my
farrier
,
girls
.
That
's
why
I
'm
posting
here
!
Help
?
I
posted
this
in
singles
and
dating
too
,
so
I
've
just
copied
and
pasted
.
Well
,
I
'll
try
to
make
this
short
.
I
have
known
this
guy
for
a
long
time
,
but
we
've
never
been
good
friends
or
anything
.
He
always
hugs
me
when
he
comes
,
but
he
gave
me
at
least
5
tight
,
long
,
back
rubbing
hugs
while
he
was
there
.
Well
,
if
you
ever
just
want
to
see
me
I
'll
come
out
and
look
him
over
and
then
we
can
grab
a
coffee
after
.
That
has
NEVER
happened
before
so
I
was
kinda
realizing
at
that
point
that
he
was
a
little
interested
.
Right
??
Anyway
,
so
he
ended
up
leaving
one
nail
out
of
my
horse
s
foot
(
I
've
never
heard
of
a
farrier
doing
this
)
and
telling
me
to
call
him
in
a
few
days
(
first
it
was
a
week
,
then
it
was
a
few
days
lol
)
and
he
'd
come
back
out
and
put
it
in
.
He
told
me
to
remember
to
call
like
3
times
before
he
left
.
So
,
I
waited
a
week
to
call
because
I
was
busy
and
I
wanted
to
have
him
come
out
on
a
day
when
I
am
more
available
in
case
we
were
to
hang
out
after
;)
Anyway
,
so
that
was
2
days
ago
that
I
called
and
left
a
message
,
but
he
still
has
n't
called
back
yet
.
I
do
n't
know
if
I
should
call
him
again
tomorrow
or
not
?
I
know
a
lot
of
people
say
to
wait
until
he
calls
you
,
but
it
's
different
because
I
'm
a
client
and
technically
that
's
all
I
am
at
this
point
.
On
the
other
hand
though
,
if
I
'm
a
client
he
should
really
of
called
back
by
now
because
you
do
n't
leave
a
customer
hanging
.
He
did
n't
have
my
number
either
because
this
was
the
first
time
I
've
called
HIM
instead
of
his
dad
.
It
's
a
father
and
son
business
.
Anyway
,
I
would
appreciate
ANY
insight
on
this
at
all
.
Thank
you
for
reading
if
you
did
!
:)
Ok
,
well
as
far
as
him
being
a
bad
farrier
for
leaving
a
nail
out
-
That
is
not
the
case
,
they
are
extremely
well
known
farriers
in
the
area
.
I
would
be
a
lot
more
concerned
if
the
shoe
fell
off
because
it
was
missing
one
lousy
nail
.
The
only
reason
I
switched
away
from
them
in
the
first
place
is
because
my
good
friend
who
apprenticed
with
them
was
starting
out
on
his
own
.
However
,
he
left
my
horse
without
a
shoe
for
TWO
WEEKS
(
now
that
's
what
I
call
a
crap
farrier
)
.
Which
,
I
might
add
is
the
same
foot
that
keeps
crumbling
with
the
nails
.
So
,
obviously
I
switched
back
to
these
guys
.
Ok
,
calm
down
,
it
's
not
like
he
's
some
stranger
that
came
up
and
groped
me
lol
.
I
've
known
the
guy
for
about
10
years
.
I
am
21
,
so
yeah
we
were
both
kids
when
we
knew
each
other
!
And
yes
,
I
do
like
him
.
To
answer
Barry
White
,
yes
that
did
occur
to
me
:)
I
hope
that
is
all
he
's
waiting
for
.
On
the
other
hand
,
he
could
very
easily
just
call
me
and
say
hey
I
'm
busy
right
now
,
I
'll
call
you
when
I
can
come
out
.
And
as
far
as
scheduled
visits
go
,
I
have
no
idea
.
I
've
never
done
that
before
though
either
.
And
they
usually
come
out
within
a
few
days
.
He
will
call
you
back
I
m
sure
!
Sounds
like
He
really
likes
you
..
But
you
need
to
ask
yourself
do
you
feel
the
same
way
?
would
You
like
going
for
*
coffee
*
with
him
?
or
is
he
Not
your
type
?
Or
are
you
undecided
?
If
i
were
you
I
would
Go
...
I
would
say
if
he
does
not
call
you
back
by
friday
call
him
again
he
could
be
playing
hard
to
get
?
I
think
he
left
the
Nail
out
of
the
shoe
as
a
excuse
to
come
back
and
see
you
hey
he
may
be
your
Prince
charming
..
Edit
...
I
really
do
nt
think
Your
horse
Is
in
danger
Of
being
hurt
With
one
Nail
missing
..
I
have
seen
horses
Loose
Nails
On
there
Own
And
do
just
fine
with
ONE
nail
gone
Now
if
he
had
left
out
2
or
3
I
would
be
wondering
to
...
I
really
do
belive
he
left
the
nail
out
becuse
of
the
horse
s
Hoof
condition
and
It
s
a
added
bonus
he
would
get
to
see
her
again
sort
a
wonder
what
it
would
have
been
like
?
But
That
was
Years
ago
.
He
had
this
Habit
of
telling
you
Everything
..
Well
one
day
he
said
to
me
You
know
i
do
n't
wear
Underwear
as
he
was
bent
over
Working
on
my
Mare
s
Right
front
hoof
..
and
I
was
Like
Ummmm
okay
???
I
m
glad
his
butt
was
facing
me
so
he
could
n't
see
my
red
face
I
think
my
Mare
was
even
laughing
..
Well
6
weeks
Later
when
he
came
back
out
He
was
again
working
on
my
mare
s
front
Foot
and
I
looked
Down
and
Yeah
he
had
Wholes
In
his
pants
In
the
wrong
places
I
bust
out
Laughing
and
He
was
like
what
???
I
was
like
Ummmm
i
can
see
your
ass
cheeks
...
he
was
like
Oops
did
i
forget
my
Underwear
???
that
was
a
strange
way
to
flirt
..
but
i
guss
it
was
his
way
...
But
like
i
said
nothing
ever
came
of
It
..
the
next
time
I
saw
him
He
had
told
Me
he
had
To
get
married
to
a
girl
Who
he
worked
with
becuse
he
knocked
Her
Up
..
I
was
heartbroken
..
but
then
realized
He
was
not
the
Guy
for
me
..
Wow
he
does
sound
interested
in
you
,
my
farrier
never
gives
me
hugs
like
that
(
probably
a
good
thing
as
he
has
a
wife
and
2
kids
)
anyway
,
I
find
that
they
can
be
very
busy
so
I
would
wait
a
week
lo9nger
and
if
still
no
reply
give
him
a
call
but
do
nâ€™t
leave
a
message
so
you
do
nâ€™t
have
to
necessarily
wait
for
him
to
call
.
From
the
point
of
view
of
a
business
,
and
client
/
operator
relationships
,
he
's
doing
a
really
shitty
job
.
Leaving
nails
out
so
you
'll
call
and
have
him
come
back
out
later
?
This
is
,
after
all
,
his
business
,
and
if
he
wants
you
to
remain
a
customer
why
on
earth
is
he
doing
shoddy
work
?
EPM
,
Anyone
Dealt
with
it
?
Might
be
something
different
?
I
have
the
opportunity
to
pick
up
a
super
nice
6
year
old
for
free
.
He
's
not
lame
,
but
he
's
been
having
issues
.
Here
's
what
the
owner
has
said
:
I
have
a
5
year
old
that
lost
all
of
his
cheek
muscle
on
the
right
side
about
3
-
4
months
ago
.
I
chalked
it
up
to
possible
nerve
damage
,
because
this
is
what
the
vet
thought
and
the
other
cheek
muscle
was
fine
and
he
had
no
theeth
problems
.
So
I
sent
him
to
the
trainers
the
first
of
September
to
be
started
on
the
barrels
.
I
got
him
back
the
first
of
the
month
and
he
had
lost
some
weight
but
attributed
that
to
be
worked
everyday
(
I
expected
him
to
drop
some
)
.
He
is
now
losing
the
cheek
muscle
on
the
left
side
of
his
face
and
seems
to
be
dropping
weight
by
the
day
.
He
can
eat
all
his
feed
and
does
n't
drop
any
,
but
can
not
eat
hay
from
lack
of
muscle
to
chew
it
.
He
is
gant
looking
in
his
flank
area
and
is
losing
topline
muscle
.
The
only
neurological
sign
that
he
shows
is
that
he
barely
drags
his
toes
and
sometimes
has
trouble
with
his
right
lead
.
The
horse
I
had
posted
about
a
couple
weeks
ago
with
the
atrophied
cheek
muscles
is
down
to
his
last
resort
for
life
.
I
CAN
NOT
afford
to
treat
whatever
is
wrong
with
him
.
NO
,
I
have
not
done
an
EPM
test
but
have
done
an
extensive
blood
panel
and
my
vet
did
a
neurological
physical
exam
.
We
elected
to
not
do
the
EPM
test
because
there
was
NO
neurological
signs
.
He
is
still
showing
no
signs
other
than
the
weight
loss
,
and
some
muscle
atrophy
.
He
eats
all
of
his
grain
but
it
just
takes
him
a
while
to
get
it
chewed
because
of
the
lack
of
muscle
in
his
jaws
.
So
I
might
get
the
horse
and
see
what
I
can
do
.
I
will
be
getting
with
my
vet
first
and
if
I
do
get
him
,
have
the
spinal
fluid
test
done
for
EPM
and
a
titer
test
.
Will
be
getting
a
copy
of
the
blood
results
the
owner
has
already
ran
as
well
.
My
other
theory
would
be
wobblers
.
I
'll
be
having
my
equine
chiro
/
acupuncturist
out
to
do
some
work
as
well
if
I
do
get
him
....
So
any
ideas
?
Think
I
should
do
it
?
Arby
,
Horse
is
out
of
state
and
not
local
.
Owner
is
willing
to
meet
me
half
way
with
him
.
I
will
be
calling
my
vet
and
chiro
about
him
.
He
's
still
rideable
currently
and
not
having
many
issues
under
saddle
.
This
is
a
horse
that
I
otherwise
would
n't
be
able
to
afford
and
even
if
I
spend
2
K
and
treatment
I
come
out
ahead
of
his
purchase
price
.
I
posted
what
the
owner
as
said
in
paragraph
2
&
3
,
that
is
not
me
to
clarify
.
She
is
the
one
that
ca
n't
afford
to
do
anything
else
for
him
in
case
he
does
n't
recover
fully
.
He
can
eat
grain
and
I
already
have
a
feed
regimen
in
my
head
for
the
guy
since
he
ca
n't
eat
regular
hay
.
I
do
n't
think
it
will
be
hard
to
keep
his
weight
up
so
long
as
he
can
eat
the
grain
.
I
am
not
going
to
go
pick
up
a
horse
I
ca
n't
afford
.
I
am
willing
to
pull
the
EPM
test
and
treat
.
The
owner
is
the
one
who
is
unable
.
I
will
also
be
having
my
other
vet
up
who
's
a
chiro
&
acupuncturist
to
evaluate
him
for
wobblers
.
July
is
when
he
started
to
exhibit
slight
symptoms
and
the
owner
and
vet
originally
thought
it
was
just
some
nerve
damage
from
something
in
the
pasture
with
no
visible
injury
.
He
's
only
exhibited
weight
loss
and
some
muscle
atrophy
,
with
the
slight
toe
drag
and
a
bit
of
trouble
with
the
right
lead
(
which
could
or
could
n't
be
related
)
.
The
horse
is
not
in
pain
.
He
's
not
starving
.
He
's
dropping
we
The
horse
is
not
in
pain
.
He
's
not
starving
.
He
's
dropping
weight
,
but
most
of
that
came
from
being
at
the
trainer
s
and
being
ridden
hard
for
60
days
.
He
's
not
putting
it
back
on
.
I
know
that
I
have
the
possibility
of
treating
him
and
still
having
to
put
him
down
.
At
the
same
time
I
do
know
people
who
have
had
horses
come
back
successfully
after
EPM
.
I
know
this
is
going
to
be
expensive
.
I
'm
willing
to
give
it
a
shot
.
Gallop
,
I
've
already
read
that
whole
site
and
been
reading
through
research
articles
from
the
research
colleges
as
well
.
Looked
at
studies
,
treatment
options
and
such
.
I
will
have
the
EPM
test
done
before
treating
.
The
chiro
/
acupuncturist
will
be
there
to
evaluate
the
horse
for
wobblers
which
is
often
caused
by
spinal
compression
and
can
be
confused
with
EPM
.
If
that
is
the
case
then
acupuncture
is
n't
going
to
hurt
him
.
It
's
actually
one
of
the
alternative
therapies
for
EPM
I
do
think
some
Y!A
users
need
to
work
on
their
reading
comprehension
as
I
ca
n't
comprehend
how
taking
a
horse
in
as
a
rescue
and
getting
it
qualified
medical
treatment
is
abuse
.
Is
that
something
you
are
up
for
?
If
so
go
for
it
and
I
'll
give
you
all
the
moral
support
I
can
as
you
figure
out
what
is
up
.
It
is
heartbreaking
to
try
to
bring
a
horse
back
and
then
have
to
put
it
down
,
but
some
horses
are
worth
the
risk
.
If
you
feel
this
guy
is
worth
it
then
I
hope
your
vet
can
figure
things
out
.
As
to
EPM
like
Shee
said
being
in
MI
we
've
had
to
deal
with
it
.
Pretty
much
every
large
stable
has
here
.
Our
first
diagnosed
EPM
horse
was
back
when
there
was
no
treatment
in
the
US
and
only
an
experimental
chicken
feed
additive
in
Canada
.
We
hauled
the
horse
to
Windsor
and
got
him
treated
there
.
That
horse
returned
to
racing
and
we
did
n't
notice
much
difference
.
We
've
had
a
few
since
then
,
but
none
since
our
race
horses
began
wintering
in
Florida
.
I
can
say
all
of
our
EPM
horses
were
treated
early
when
they
were
showing
mild
signs
like
Shee
gave
and
all
returned
to
racing
.
One
horse
even
got
his
lifetime
mark
after
being
treated
for
EPM
.
We
've
always
liked
big
long
trotters
that
do
better
on
mile
tracks
then
1
/
2
mile
.
The
only
difference
we
noticed
is
that
the
EPM
horses
seemed
to
do
worse
on
the
smaller
tracks
after
.
It
might
just
be
coincidence
or
the
fact
those
great
big
trotters
with
those
extremely
long
backs
lost
a
bit
of
fine
coordination
to
get
those
gangly
bodies
around
those
tighter
turns
.
I
do
n't
know
.
MSU
does
a
lot
of
EPM
studies
because
of
how
common
it
is
here
.
You
may
want
to
see
if
you
can
get
in
touch
with
their
EPM
group
and
get
this
guy
in
a
study
.
I
know
they
did
lab
work
showing
that
Strongid
C
used
daily
could
help
prevent
EPM
.
I
believe
they
have
a
real
study
testing
the
lab
work
in
real
world
situations
now
,
but
it
may
be
some
time
before
those
results
are
released
.
Another
thought
with
this
being
a
mosquito
season
from
hell
could
it
be
West
Nile
?
West
Nile
can
cause
EPM
like
symptoms
and
does
n't
always
include
a
fever
.
Let
us
know
what
you
decide
to
do
.
You
hate
to
see
talent
get
wasted
,
but
honestly
I
do
n't
think
I
could
take
in
a
horse
right
now
these
issues
.
Personally
I
think
you
should
just
keep
on
walking
by
.
You
should
have
you
chiro
out
before
you
decide
if
you
want
this
horse
or
not
.
If
you
have
a
good
repoire
(
which
I
'm
sure
you
do
)
with
them
,
they
should
be
honest
on
if
this
horse
is
fixable
to
any
degree
...
not
really
sure
what
you
want
to
do
with
him
...
So
all
in
all
,
put
the
money
up
front
before
taking
on
this
horse
.
Could
he
have
had
a
blow
to
the
head
causing
this
atrophy
?
Or
a
difficult
birth
?
Was
it
always
like
this
?
Or
has
it
occurred
since
birth
.
I
also
wonder
if
he
might
have
had
a
slight
stroke
?
I
think
if
you
can
not
afford
to
get
him
treated
that
you
should
not
consider
him
as
a
prospect
.
Who
knows
what
the
future
might
hold
,
and
it
might
be
expensive
?
Extremely
bad
customer
service
Do
not
go
to
this
salon
,
especially
if
you
have
to
get
your
hair
straightened
.
They
did
a
very
bad
job
with
my
hair
and
were
extremely
rude
when
I
went
back
to
ask
them
why
it
did
n't
work
for
my
hair
.
Rude
,
insensitive
,
discourteous
people
!!!!!
Great
Doc
Dr
Greenwalt
fixed
my
neck
from
a
snowboard
injury
and
was
way
more
effective
that
a
regular
doctor
.
He
did
nt
prescribe
pain
meds
or
other
drugs
,
he
used
his
bodytalk
method
which
is
unusual
but
the
results
are
undeniable
.
My
neck
is
fixed
!.
He
knows
what
he
s
doing
.
Our
Wedding
11/7/08
We
just
had
our
wedding
on
11/7/08
and
was
very
impressed
.
Cj
and
company
did
all
that
we
ask
and
10
times
more
.
The
food
was
out

If
you
need
a

that
is
affordable
and
easy
to
work
with
they
are
the
ones
.

Excellent
Tattoo
Shop
I
would
highly
recommend
this
shop
to
anyone
looking
to
get
a
quality
tattoo
done
.
Good
and
Bad
I
had
to
take
care
of
the
ants
myself
.
But
I
found
the
location
wonderful
and
found
the
neighbors
very
kind
.
Never
had
a
problem
with
the
staff
and
found
them
very
helpful
when
something
went
wrong
.
Loved
the
pool
and
BBQ
.
Because
of
the
ants
I
dropped
them
to
a
3
star

care

great
care
for
my
two
dogs

Lynda
is
professional
and
has
great
compassion
for
animals
.
The
real
testament
is
not
in
how
much
she
likes
your
animals
but
how
much
they
like
her
.
I
highly
recommend
her
.

these

were
fantastic

they
fixed

doors

less
than

hour

the
guy
came
on
time
and
did
n't
take
any
breaks
,
he
went
straight
to
work
and
finished
the
job
efficiently
and
promptly

Needs
to

They
close
whenever
they

it

often
well
before
their

They
do

take
coupons
.
They

Baffled
by
the
one

star
reviews
I
do
n't
get
it
.
This
place
is
awesome
,
with
a
great
ambiance
and
cool
dÃ©cor
,
and
the
food
is
scrumptious
(
and
especially
their
signature
banana
split
)
.
Sure
,
some
items
are
a
little
pricey
,
but
c'm
on
...
have
you
ever
been
out
to
eat
in
Seattle
before
?
I
've
only
had
good
experiences
at
Adorn
,
I
was
greeted
and
offered
a
refreshment
.
I
highly
recommend
Debi
,
she
does
an
amazing
job
,
I
"
love
"
the
way
she
cuts
my
hair
,
extremely
thorough
and
cross
checks
her
work
to
make
sure
my
hair
is
perfect
.
I
always
leave
loving
my
hair
style
.
The
food
here
is
fresh
and
hot
out
of
the
Wok
.
The
food
is
cooked
fast
by
the
two
chefs
on
duty
.
The
lunch
specials
are
more
food
than
most
people
can
eat
for
about
$
6
.
It
is
busy
every
day
at
lunch
for
a
reason
,
the
service
is
fast
and
the
food
is
great

Pure
Pilates
!!
It
is
the
real
thing
-
I
have
been
practicing
Pilates
for
over
7
years
and
would
not
go
anywhere
else
.
It
is
the
attention
to
detail
and
the
quality
of
the
work
taught
at
TomiPilates
that
sets
this
studio
apart
from
the
others
.
The
teachers
are
highly
trained
and
are
expert
at
handling
all
types
of
clients
.
I
phoned
this
company
for
advice
on
our
office
refurb
and
although
we
did
not
use
them
in
the
end
(
as
our
building
contractor
carried
out
the
electrical
work
)
,
they
provided
me
with
plenty
of
useful
information
over
an
hour
phone
call
and
subsequently
we
are
now
using
PJC
as
our
electrical
maintenance
contractor
.
Thoroughly
recommended
They
really
go
above
and
beyond
!
For
example
,
I
actually
forgot
to
feed
my
cat
,
and
they
went
out
of
their
way
to
take
care
of
him
.
Additionally
,
when
there
was
confusion
(
my
fault
)
,
they
left
me
flowers
along
with
a
personalized
gift
.
They
have
been
100
%
reliable
and
professional
.
Definitely
recommend

just
for

to

people
,
the
product

the

Nothing

that
really
stands
the

The

But
furniture
like
this
will

The
internet
here
is
terrible
.
Like
the
previous
poster
said
,
the
com
lines
are
split

Great
out
night

Extensive
drink
list
and
daily
specials
but
wish
they
had
a
bit
more
on
their
food
menu
,
although
popcorn
is
a
nice
touch
!
(
other
items
:
chicken
fingers
,
wings
,
asian
pizza
,
and
yam
and
regular
fries
)
Their
food
and
sweets
are
awesome
.
But
service
is
very
poor
.
Attitude
of
staff
very
bad
.
Never
gives
a
receipt
.
Sometimes
even
gives
wrong
dish
.
So
confused
at
the
payment
area
.
Line
up
is
so
stupid
.
Even
if
you
line
up
.
To
make
a
order
you
may
have
to
go
to
back
of
line
.
And
then
wait
again
.
Not
organised
.
and
there
prices
are
really
good
!
Food
here
is
absolutely
superb
.
The
waiting
staff
is
beyond
impeccable
(
they
refold
your
napkin
when
you
go
to
the
bathroom
)
.
If
you
want
great
food
then
L'espalier
is
the
place
to
go
.
I
did
n't
end
up
buying
my
car
here
,
but
I
did
think
the
guy
who
worked
with
me
was
pretty
cool
-
he
was
willing
to
budge
a
little
on
the
price
which
means
a
lot
to
me
.
Also
they
will
fill
your
tires
with
air
and
other
small
maintenance
tasks
for
free
,
even
if
you
did
n't
buy
your
car
there
!
Before
you

ANYTHING
in
NY

you

first
.
Their
selection
is
random
,
so
what
they
have
on
a
given
week
might
never
be
available
again
at
the
store
.
Trust
me
,
you
go
there
once
and
you
-ll
always
go
back
!
First
Time
Ballerina
My
daughter
is
starting
ballet
this
year
for
the
first
time
.
I
'm
a
soccer
mom
so
I
was
n't
sure
what
I
was
looking
for
when
it
comes
to
dancewear
.
The
staff
was
very
helpful
and
gave
me
exactly
what
I
needed
for
my
first
time
ballerina
.
The
service
at
Instep
was
great
!!
I
would
recommend
them
to
anyone
!
Outstanding
service
&
quality
at
a
very
affordable
price
!
This
place
is
top
notch
and
highly
affordable
!
I
would
recommend
it
hands
down
and
am
a
loyal
customer
.
I
've
also
sent
over
a
number
of
friends
to
use
the
services
here
and
everyone
is
extraordinarily
pleased
!
Thanks
for
doing
such
great
work
on
my
important
pieces
of
clothing
that
always
look
great
!
Tried
Crust
on
Broad
on
3
occasions
.
Twice
for
dinner
and
once
for
lunch
Absolutely
rude
service
every
time
!
The
staff
will
not
even
answer
the
phone
for
take
out
.
Tonight
,
I
called
several
times
with
no
answer
(
Btwn
5:30
and
6
pm
)
and
finally
drove
there
to
place
my
order
in
person
.
There
was
not
a
customer
to
be
found
.
we
purchased
a
new
home
but
was
unable
to
sell
our
old
house
so
we
contacted
this
property
management
company
and
they
have
helped
us
quickly
rent
out
our
house
and
keep
it
maintained
.
Great
help
!
We
just
got
our
sunroom
built
by
Patio
World
and
can
say
that
I
'm
extremely
happy
with
the
whole
thing
.
From
the
amount
of
time
spent
with
us
to
explain
things
during
the
initial
quote
,
to
the
communication
through
the
approval
process
to
the
actual
workmanship
of
the
build
itself
.
I
have
nothing
bad
to
say
.
Very
glad
that
we
went
with
them
.
No
Customer
Service
Another
person
in
the
store
stood
there
with
an
item
and
repeatedly
tried
to
get
a
sales
person
s
attention
.
It
was
n't
until
he
gave
up
and
walked
out
the
door
that
someone
asked
Can
I
help
you
.
do
NOT
bring
your
car
here
I
got
a
coupon
from
Pennysaver
for
this
station
.
Yes
,
they
accepted
it
.
However
,
during
the
test
,
they
did
whatever
they
can
to
get
my
test
failed
.
Then
,
they
sold
me
overpriced
stuffs
,
such
as
oil
tank
cap
,
so
that
my
car
can
pass
it
right
away
.
I
ended
up
paying
much
more
.
Are
you
kidding
me
?
I
do
n't
get
it
.
Spongy
and
sweet
bread
(
microwaved
?
)
,
heartless
salsa
,
tiny
dogs
...
You
order
at
the
counter
and
there
is
a
space
for
tip
on
your
credit
card
receipt
.
The
dude
who
grills
the
retarded
dogs
is
rude
.
I
called
on
a
Friday
at
12:30
complaining
of
a
severe
toothache
.
Dr.
Obina
told
me
that
his
office
closed
at
noon
and
that
I
should
call
him
on
Monday
.
There
are
plenty
of
good
dentists
in
Fernandina
.
Do
n't
go
to
Amelia
Gentle
Dentistry
.
Good
location
For
a
hotel
like
this
you
would
expect
some
form
of
free
internet
.
What
you
get
is
a
$
13
/
day
charge
to
access
the
internet
through
a
slow
512
/
512
kb
/
s
that
you
can
only
use
to
check
email
etc
(
Read
:
No
downloading
)
.
Other
than
that
the
hotel
is
in
a
good
location
and
the
breakfast
is
great
Make
You
Feel
Like
a
Number
You
NEVER
get
a
human
on
the
phone
.
It
's
impossible
to
get
an
appointment
.
If
you
get
caught
in
traffic
and
are
a
couple
minutes
late
they
make
you
re-schedule
...
for
6
weeks
later
.
And
worst
of
all
your
child
feels
like
a
number
not
a
patient
.
Go
somewhere
else
.
Rcommended
by

Highly
recommended

Joe

a

appreciated
the
environmentally

He

Deb
Watson

she
and
the

of

were
great
!!!
She

help
me

if
I
have
a

Since

First
time
eating
at
Caffe
Bella
Italia
and
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
.
From
the
delectable
Antipasto
Misto
to
the
Spaghetti
alla
Barese
and
the
Parmigiana
and
ending
with
gelato
,
all
was
mouth
watering
.
Too
bad
they
were
out
of
the
Chocolate
Lava
Cake
.
Maybe
next
time
they
will
have
it
.
Service
was
excellent
!
Sandy
Beware
of
Sharayu
Apart
from
that
in
spite
of
my
repeated
attempts
I
could
not
get
in
touch
with
the
manager
to
even
lodge
an
official
complaint
.
Course
has
come
a
long
way
!!
The
comment
below
definitely
needs
to
be
retracted
!
Come
back
and
give
HCC
a
second
chance
at
least
!
It
is
a
great
course
for
local
golfers
to
be
proud
of
and
all
the
comments
in
2008
have
been
very
positive
!!
Excellent
Physiotherapists
!
Kusal
Goonewardena
and
his
team
of
Physios
are
unbelievable
!
It
took
the
Vigor
team
only
4
visits
to
get
me
feeling
normal
!
Thanks
guys
!
They
must
have
read
these
reviews
and
improved
!
My
husband
and
I
happened
in
on
a
whim
.
We
sat
in
the
front
dining
area
,
it
was
very
cozy
and
pleasant
.
Our
server
was
quite
attentive
and
the
food
was
fantastic
.
My
husband
has
been
a
professional
chef
,
so
he
is
a
good
judge
of
quality
food
.
This
was
a
flavorful
,
enjoyable
meal
for
both
of
us
.
Rude
Rude
Rude
went
in
there
and
got
my
dog
groomed
came
home
to
an
uneven
dog
then
took
him
back
to
get
evened
up
what
a
mistake
!
she
did
nt
even
let
me
finish
a
sentence
without
insulting
me
and
telling
me
how
i
should
have
said
it
!
i
wo
nt
go
back
!
she
needs
to
develop
a
personality
!
brought
dog
home
and
it
s
all
choppy
now
!
It
's
helpful
to
know
a
quite
a
bit
about
bull
fighting
.
If
you
watch
a
lot
of
fights
(
youtube
)
and
research
some
of
the
history
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting
)
you
will
find
yourself
enjoying
it
a
lot
more
!
Also
after
seeing
a
handful
of
bullfights
,
I
can
say
that
they
're
a
lot
more
enjoyable
if
you
're
smashed
(
BAC
>=
.15
)
.
All
I
can
say
is
that
I
am
glad
I
went
in
!
The
nurses
are
sweet
as
pie
and
the
doctor
is
wonderful
.
This
place
is
about
healing
,
not
making
a
buck
.
The
followup
visit
is
FREE
!!
After
going
to
the
hospital
and
paying
ER
prices
...
there
is
no
way
I
wo
n't
be
back
here
!!
I
will
be
back
and
telling
EVERYONE
about
this
clinic
.
THANK
YOU
!!
I
just
like
the
fact
that
he
was
able
to
do
the
specific
type
of
repair
I
wanted
(
a
reball
)
and
give
me
the
longest
warranty
and
even
a
lower
price
.
Someone
else
I
found
that
said
they
could
do
it
but
wanted
to
charge
me
more
and
give
me
less
warranty
.
It
was
a
no
brainer
really
.
This
place
is
bad
.
It
's
dark
,
dingy
&
dirty
.
This
place
may
have
been
something
sometime
;
but
it
way
past
it
"
sell
by
date
"
.
I
have
eaten
here
twice
in
the
past
year
and
will
not
go
back
and
can
not
recommend
it
.

RIP
Victim
of
hard
times

I
suspect
failing
corporate
management

According

news
accounts

you

We
are
very
pleased
with
the
services
of
First
Glass
Window
.
Our
window
panes
were
so
dirty
that
they
needed
a
specialist
to
come
and
clean
them
.
We
called
few
companies
before
we
decide
to
hire
them
.
They
came
on
time
and
completed
their
work
quickly
.
We
were
very
happy
how
clean
looked
our
windows
.
If
you
have
some
problems
with
your
windows
,
you
should
call
them
.
Great
help
even
near
closing
time
!
I
came
in
to
town
for
a
week
and
forgot
my
trainers
!
Oh
no
!!
They
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
me
and
got
me
into
a
great
pair
of
shoes
.
Thanks
Run
on
!
Great
This
is
a
perfect
place
to
get
your
hair
done
.
I
have
gone
there
time
and
time
again
whenever
I
need
to
get
my
hair
done
or
when
I
want
a
haircut
.
When
I
get
my
hair
done
there
,
they
use
enough
hairstyling
products
while
it
does
not
ruin
your
hair
.
The
service
is
great
and
during
weekends
it
tends
to
get
busy
,
but
the
wait
is
worthwhile
.
Highly
Recommend
I
have
worked
with
Shannon
as
my
massage
therapist
and
intuitive
bodyworker
for
years
and
have
never
been
disappointed
.
She
has
not
only
helped
me
through
some
challenging
computer
-
work
and
sports
related
injuries
,
she
was
wonderful
to
work
with
throughout
my
pregnancy
and
beyond
.
I
highly
recommend
her
.
What
a
fantastic
store
,
I
love
this
place
.
Not
the
same
old
stuff
that
all
the
other
stores
have
.
Their
items
are
very
unique
,
great
quality
,
great
prices
.
Dr.
Aster
and
her
team
have
been
a
strong
advocate
in
the
health
of
both
my
daughters
.
She
is
and
excellent
doctor
to
have
on
one
's
team
.
My
wife
and
I
avoided
doing
some
fairly
simple
electrical
re-wiring
in
our
home
for
several
years
due
to
overall
hassle
and
cost
involved
.
I
finally
called
Matt
from
Bonafide
and
he
made
the
project
both
easy
for
us
and
reasonable
.
I
will
reccommend
his
services
however
/
whenever
possible
!
Real
pros
I
've
had
writer
friends
describe
horror
stories
with
their
printers
.
I
tell
them
:
why
not
just
go
with
these
guys
?
Richard
Joule
and
the
gang
are
pros
from
start
to
finish
.
They
set
out
to
exceed
your
expectations
.
Already
I
'm
considering
future
projects
,
and
I
can
assure
you
that
for
my
printing
needs
I
will
be
choosing
no
other
than
Atlanta
Paperback
Book
Printing
.
I
have
been
here
3
times
and
all
3
times
it
has
been
bad
!
They
have
messed
up
my
order
and
....
The
food
was
just
not
good
!
I
hope
they
get
there
act
together
...
I
am
going
to
give
it
one
last
chance
in
next
few
months
and
see
??
I
called
them
for
an
estimate
and
they
INSULTED
ME
WHEN
I
ASK
THEM
QUESTIONS
.
THEY
ARE
VERY
RUDE
AND
NASTY
.
PLEASE
DO
N'T
USE
THIS
MOVING
COMPANY
IF
YOU
DO
N'T
WANT
TO
:
CRY
,
HAVE
TROUBLE
AND
A
BAD
EXPERIENCE
ON
THE
DAY
OF
YOUR
MOVE
.
THEY
WILL
GIVE
YOU
A
LOW
PRICE
OVER
THE
PHONE
AND
ON
THE
DAY
OF
YOUR
MOVE
THEY
WILL
CHANGE
THE
PRICE
,
I
GUARANTEE
IT
.
I
am
hiring
them
to
come
once
a
week
now
that
they
got
my
house
to
where
they
can
maintain
it
for
only
an
hour
and
a
half
every
two
weeks
!
Especially
high
end
keep
sake
sort
of
clothing
that
you
just
ca
nt
find
in
a
lot
of
stores
.
It
is
all
very
unique
and
you
wo
nt
find
any
other
baby
wearing
the
same
stuff
.
I
spent
quite
a
bit
because
I
spoil
my
little
princess
.
After
all
she
will
only
be
a
baby
for
so
long
I
figure
why
not
enjoy
it
.
Antique

Fixtures

Chicago
Great
place
for
Antique
Lighting
!
I
visited
their
huge
Chicago
lighting
showroom
and
all
I
have
to
say
is
WOW
!!
I
think
they
have
the
largest
collection
for
Chandeliers
Chicago
.
Antiques
,
Vintage
,
Contemporary
&
Modern
Chandeliers
.
I
would
recommend
them
for
any
custom
lighting
or
Lighting
Repair
and
Restoration
Chicago
Great
Food
Awesome
food
Awesome
service
I
wanted
to
try
someplace
new
again
.
This
place
rocked
.
Brought
my
wife
Deb
with
me
and
she
like
the
Fried
Crab
Wontons
and
said
they
were
good
..
We
also
had
the
BBQ
Spare
Ribs
..
good
also
.
I
ordered
the
MOO
SHU
pork
and
it
was
great
..
I
also
ordered
the
Neptune
Platter
which
was
awesome
...
so
this
place
gets
5
out
of
5
stars
.
DO
NOT
GO
HERE
!!!
I
went
to
get
my
nails
filled
Friday
,
by
Monday
2
were
broken
.
I
was
not
happy
with
the
way
they
looked
,
very
wavy
,
uneven
edges
,
and
with
the
exception
of
1
,
there
is
a
dip
in
the
center
of
each
nail
.
I
also
had
a
pedicure
,
and
they
cut
my
nails
too
short
,
one
of
my
big
toes
looks
like
it
s
getting
infected
.
No
way
.
I
'm
certainly
no
expert
on
asian
food
in
fact
not
even
a
lover
of
Vietnamese
food
but
I
wanted
to
try
the
real
things
here
at
A
Dong
.
Not
good
,
not
great
,
and
again
another
disappointment
in
Central
Iowa
.
How
do
these
places
stay
in
business
.
This
town
needs
some
food
soul
and
this
is
not
it
.
Worth
Every
Penny
My
girlfriend
and
I
ate
at
The
Grill
last
night
,
and
our
experience
was
amazing
.
Everything
we
ordered
was
prepared
to
perfection
,
and
was
presented
perfectly
.
I
will
sum
it
up
with
,
it
was
worth
every
penny
!
All
the
food
tasted
excellent
,
and
with
the
new
renovation
of
chairs
and
the
bathroom
,
it
is
awesome
.
The
people
working
their
are
also
extremely
polite
and
friendly
.
Every
time
I
go
,
Kevin
,
the
manager
,
will
always
remember
my
family
and
I
.
Overall
,
it
is
very
family
oriented
,
and
I
recommend
it
to
everyone
!!!
Furnace
repair
Tiger
Heating
is
awesome
.
I
had
John
and
Dustin
working
feverishly
to
get
my
exhaust
motor
replaced
.
These
guys
were
absolutely
professional
.
John
was
here
in
45
minutes
after
I
called
on
a
10
below
zero
early
Sunday
morning
.
If
you
need
someone
to
help
you
out
with
your
heating
problems
,
I
DEFINITELY
would
call
TIGER
HEATING
and
AIR
.
Absolutely
a
wonderful
company
.
My
family
and
I
thank
you
!!!!!!!!!!
They
Suck
Go
somewhere
else
...
Wanted
to
buy
a
Rhino
700
and
a
Grizzly
700
.
After
searching
high
and
low
for
a
salesman
,
I
was
treated
like
dirt
,
and
we
left
.
Professional
and
inspiring
His
knowledge
and
expertise
help
smooth
the
way
with
any
planning
application
,
ensuring
compliance
with
the
building
regulations
.
Once
you
have
met
Nigel
you
will
not
want
to
work
with
anyone
else
.
He
really
does
turn
your
dreams
into
reality
for
your
home
!
We
came
at
around
730
and
they
close
at
8
and
wanted
to
try
the
specials
but
they
were
out
for
the
day
so
I
would
say
go
way
before
they
close
.
Got
the
crab
rangoon
which
was
great
,
tofu
with
cabbage
which
was
spicy
but
good
and
shrimp
satay
which
was
also
good
.
Def
going
to
come
back
and
try
this
place
again
.
Bea
was
really
nice
and
asked
how
the
food
was
.
Cute
place
also
As
a
native
southern
Californian
I
can
tell
you
that
this
is
not
authentic
Mexican
food
.
However
,
I
still
like
this
place
a
lot
.
Esp.
the
mole
,
tortilla
soup
,
and
guacamole
.
Margaritas
are
alright
.
My
only
complaint
is
the
QUESO
.
It
used
to
be
fabulous
,
why
did
you
guys
change
it
??
Queso
should
not
be
watery
:(
.....
***

NEVER
MIND
!
They
fixed
the
queso
!
Thank
you

There
are
so

do
n't

waste
your
time
here
.
I
had
the
morelias
enchiladas
.
The
sauce
was
dry
and
the
enchiladas
did
not
taste
good
.
at
all
.
In
fact
my
friend
vomited
after
our
meal
.
Maybe
we
ordered
the
wrong
dish
but
my
experience
here
was
poor
.
Service
was
okay
not
great
,
we
came
for
a
late
lunch
.
I
do
n't
recommend
this
place
.
Skylight
repair
My
skylight
was
making
a
horrible
noise
when
the
wind
blew
.
James
Bateman
came
the
day
I
called
and
fixed
the
problem
quickly
and
efficiently
.
He
called
the
next
day
to
see
if
everything
was
to
my
satisfaction
.
When
the
next
hailstorm
blows
through
,
I
will
not
hesitate
to
contact
James

Small
Firm
with
Great
Service
Bloom
Legal
was
really
attentive
to
my
problem
,
and
Seth
Bloom
took
the
time
to
help
me
understand
the
legal
issue
I
was
dealing
with
.
I
much
preferred
the
one
-
on
-
one
service
here
to
the
experiences
I
've
had
with
bigger
offices
and
firms
.
While
I
hope
I
do
n't
have
any
need
for
a
lawyer
anytime
soon
,
if
I
do
I
'll
definitely
use
this
firm
again
.
Used
their
service
for
the
first
time
and
was
immediately
impressed
by
their
professionalism
(
received
a
phone
call
soon
after
order
was
placed
to
confirm
details
)
and
the
subsequent
delivery
of
my
gift
(
To
Split
,
Croatia
)
was
as
requested
.
The
gift
itself
was
exactly
as
described
and
pictured
in
the
catalogue
and
of
the
highest
standard
.
Would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
requiring
overseas
gift
delivery

Over-rated
...
This
restaurant
is
over-rated
.
It
is
hard
to
find
...
and
the
mexican
food
is
bland
,
almost
equivalent
to
eating
out
of
a
can
.
The
service
is
poor
...
I
asked
for
a
fried
egg
on
my
enchiladas
...
and
did
not
get
it
.!
The
Chili
Relleno
..
had
no
batter
on
it
.
I
googled
restaurants
in
the
area
and
Fuji
Sushi
came
up
and
reviews
were
great
so
I
made
a
carry
out
order
of
:
L

Mixed
Tempura
.....................

Shrimp
or

tempura
&

I
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
even
more
please
with
the
portion
size
,
to
go
box
set
up
and
quality
of
the
food
for
the
price
.
I
'm
very
happy
and
will
definitely
dine
in
and
carry
out
again
.

Good
Pizza
at
a
good
price
I
just
moved
nearby
and
have
tried
several
of
the
local
places
,
this
was
the
first
one
and
I
should
have
just
stuck
with
it
.
The
pizza
is
usually
pretty
good
,
the
only
bad
one
we
got
was
on
a
Friday
night
and
it
just
needed
to
be
cooked
a
little
more
,
but
it
was
still
good
.
HORRIBLE
SERVICE
!!!
Absolute
horrible
service
from
the
parts
department
.
They
are
very
rude
over
the
phone
and
in
person
.
How
these
guys
can
get
away
with
being
so
rude
with
people
is
mind
blowing
.
I
will
NEVER
do
business
with
Sun
Toyota
again
.
Thank
god
there
are
plenty
of
Toyota
dealerships
to
choose
from
in
this
city
.
this
is
a
good
place
I
have
been
here
before
and
the
service
was
absoulutely
great
.
i
reccomend
you
to
go
and
enjoy
their
wonderful
hospitality
.
Anna
Marie
and
Govind
are
very
sweet
people
,
and
the
minute
you
steep
into
their
school
,
the
calm
loving
atmosphere
takes
over
,
and
tension
and
worries
stay
outside
in
the
street
,
whether
or
not
you
pick
them
up
again
after
class
is
probably
a
question
of
practice
.
A
wonderful
place
,
if
you
want
more
than
just
the
physical
side
of
yoga
.
Give
yourself
the
gift
of
trying
this
place
,
to
see
if
it
fits
you
...
They
do
n't
seem
to
be
interested
in
selling
cars
.
Went
there
yesterday
:
we
are
trying
to
decide
between
two
different
Honda
models
,
so
we
wanted
to
test
-
drive
both
back
to
back
.
The
salesperson
refused
!
Claimed
he
was
too
busy
for
two
test
drives
.
We
were
the
only
customers
there
!
Do
n't
waste
time
,
just
drive
10
minutes
more
down
to
Stevens
Creek
,
they
actually
do
try
to
help
their
customers
there
!
ATE

A
COUPLE

.
IT
IS
NOT
A
HIGH
END
STEAK

,
MORE

SO
,
IF

,
IT
IS

.
IF
YOU

Eulogic
Good
place
to
be
on
a
Sunday
Night
.
The
beers
were
good
,
nice
choice
of
beers
as
well
,
and
as
usual
the
mussels
were
great
,
the
place
upstairs
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
bar
downstairs
.
Filled
up
on
too
much
beer
and
hence
can
not
comment
on
the
food
.
But
the
menu
had
standard
stuff
that
one
would
get
at
a
Belgian
Tavern
.
If
you
are
a
handcraft
beer
person
,
this
is
a
fantastic
place
to
be
.
Perfect
Location
plus
I
used
to
live
at
Meadowrun
and
that
was
a
nightmare
.
The
manager
-
Tiffany
-
is
actually
very
nice
so
I
'm
a
bit
surprised
by
other
comments
.
She
's
very
reachable
and
she
has
always
responded
quickly
to
any
questions
or
requests
.
Plus
she
plans
a
monthly
breakfasts
and
other
events
at
the
clubhouse
which
is
a
nice
added
benefit
.
great
service
/
deals
-
support
this
local
business
I
have
used
these
guys
for
new
snows
,
fixing
lots
of
flats
,
used
replacement
tires
,
and
oil
changes
.
AND
they
're
usually
able
to
help
you
as
a
walk
-
in
,
and
they
're
fast
.
Overall
-
good
stuff
.
Another
great
business
bites
the
dust
!
A
bit
pricey
,
so
I
did
n't
go
very
often
,
but
it
was
always
a
treat
when
I
did
.
The
prices
were
worth
what
I
got
.
I
'm
assuming
they
are
completely
out
of
business
since
I
ca
n't
find
any
contact
information
.
I
'm
hoping
the
bakers
continue
to
do
their
baking
out
of
another
place
,
because
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
have
these
cakes
any
longer
.
Super
nice
people
,
really
good
food
What
I
love
most
about
this
place
,
other
than
the
food
,
is
that
eating
here
makes
you
feel
like
you
're
in
a
small
town
rather
than
Baltimore
.
The
owners
are
really
nice
,
they
serve
good
food
at
a
good
price
,
and
the
option
to
eat
outside
on
the
deck
(
esp
on
the
weekend
whether
there
is
hardly
any
traffic
)
is
great
.
One
of
my
top
5
places
to
eat
in
Baltimore
.
Overpriced
The
food
is
mediocre
at
best
,
and
largely
overpriced
given
the
portion
size
and
quality
.
Do
n't
even
get
me
started
on
how
expensive
it
is
to
drink
there
.
I
have
ate
here
3
times
since
they
first
opened
,
and
the
service
has
been
poor
each
time
,
the
staff
always
comes
across
as
somewhat
rude
and
slow
.

Enjoyed
this

little
spot
with
a
group
of
8
folks
.
Service
was
excellent
.
Food
was
excellent
.
Wine
was

I
was

need
for

fish
so
I
had
the

which
was
very
good
but
the
steaks
looked
amazing
and
if
I
am
in

,
I
'll
definitely
order
a

Very

!!!!
They
interviewed
me
,
gave
me
tests
in
the
software
I
included
on
my
resume
,
and
placed
me
in
a
position
that
I
kept
for
several
years
.
Re-interviewed
and
am
going
on
interviews
for
a
new
job
.
I
'm
really
thankful
for
the
folks
at
HR
Office
.
They
are
dependable
,
have
great
connections
in
the
community
,
and
are
a
great
resource
for
finding
a
job
.
I
highly
recommend
them
to
all
of
my
friends
!!!!
!
Great
experience
-
consider
checking
out
their
puppies
before
buying
from
a
breeder
!
The
staff
was
very
helpful
in
finding
the
right
dog
for
me
and
the
care
my
pup
received
was
outstanding
.
If
you
are
on
the
lookout
for
a
pure
breed
pup
do
n't
forget
to
check
out
the
shelters
!
Food

No

ended
up
having
to
use
my

Asked

-

-
que

Never
checked
back
with
us
once
we
got
our
food
.
Had
to
go
the
the
bus
boy
s
station
ourselves
to
get
napkins
.
Food
was
good
,
but
service
means
a
lot
to
me
.
Even
though
you
are
expensive
.
Thank
you
for
helping
to
preserve

.
You
are
meticulous
in
your
work
and
it

Con
Garage
I
brought
my
car
in
for
a
simple
emissions
test
.
I
guess
they
figured
me
for
an
easy
mark
,
and
tried
to
explain
that
my
car
would
n't
pass
unless
I
replaced
a
hose
.
Ten
minutes
later
,
I
took
my
car
down
the
street
and
it
passed
the
emissions
test
with
flying
colors
.
If
you
're
a
fan
of
herpes
,
being
ripped
off
,
and
child
molesters
,
this
is
the
garage
for
you
.
If
not
,
go
somewhere
else
.
Rude
service
even
though
I
have
never
tried
hoa
salon
but
I
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
they
are
rude
.
I
called
and
asked
about
the
price
for
hair
updo
and
the
receptionist
or
owner
who
aswered
the
phone
refused
to
tell
me
,
or
even
just
give
me
an
approximate
price
range
.
He
told
us
to
stop
by
the
salon
and
then
he
will
tell
us
the
price
.
What
kind
of
rude
service
is
that
?
I
do
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
with
them
.
Top

just
off

Fantastic
food
served
without
pretense
,
very
reasonably
priced
wine
selections
.
A
great
place
to
go
for
dinner
after
a
day
of
wine
tasting
.
Excellent
Service
and
Reasonable
Prices
but
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
the
Purple
Goose
's
prices
are
reasonable
(
for
the
SAME
products
found
at
other
area
boutiques
,
the
prices
were
20
-
25
%
cheaper
)
.
The
service
was
also
excellent
-
friendly
,
helpful
and
informative
without
being
overbearing
.
Will
definitely
return
.
Consistantly
poor
Chasing
them
on
issues
from
the
day
I
moved
in
(
many
of
them
still
unresolved
as
I
left
)
to
all
sorts
of
farcical
issues
with
funds
,
after
I
left
.
.
.
.
as
soon
as
I
could
.
If
you
must
use
them
,
be
vigilant
and
be
ready
to
push
,
if
you
can
go
elsewhere
then
I
would
.

it
was
their
opening
!
Anyway
,
once
that
is
fixed
,
this
place
will
be
amazing
.
Drinks
were
awesome
,
prices
reasonable
,
and
staff
friendly
.
This
is
an
awesome
date
spot
that
the
area
SERIOUSLY
needs
.
Check
out
The
Willow
Lounge
,
you
ll
be
happy
!
It
s
been
a
few
years
since
I
have
been
to
Ipanema
.
But
my
wife
and
I
first
went
there
thinking
it
would
be
Brazilian
food
(
think
lots
of
meat
)
,
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
vegan
restaurant
!
And
,
I
can
say
,
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
places
to
eat
in
all
of
Richmond
.
Amazing
!
Do
n't
let
the
nondescript
building
entrance
fool
you
,
these
are
some
creative
and
talented
chefs
...
two
thumbs
way
,
way
up
!
Excellent
food
,
fantastic
wait
staff
I
recently
threw
a
surprise
birthday
party
for
my
wife
at
Fraiser
's
.
We
had
30
guests
for
the
event
,
and
everyone
came
away
from
the
evening
impressed
with
not
only
the
food
,
but
the
outstanding
service
as
well
.
The
management
was
easy
to
deal
with
during
the
planning
stages
,
and
the
execution
by
the
kitchen
and
wait
staff
was
flawless
.
I
highly
recommend
Fraiser
's
for
anyone
planning
a
special
event
for
friends
,
family
or
business
.
FANTASTIC
STORE
!!!
I
came
upon
this
store
as
the
building
caught
my
eye
.
The
store
was
decorated
with
furnishings
&
accessories
.
The
friendly
crew
working
was
great
&
very
helpful
.
This
store
is
what
Colorado
is
all
about
.
Also
,
I
purchased
some
furniture
last
year
and
all
has
been
great
!
It's
durability
&
look
was
perfect
and
I
will
definitely
be
adding
to
my
collection
soon
!
Lovely
People
,
Great
Hats
It
led
me
to
believe
that
the
reviewers
simply
had
difficulty
tolerating
people
with
strongly
-
accented
English
.
The
husband
and
wife
who
run
this
spot
are
lovely
people
.
We
have
had
many
conversations
with
them
and
they
have
always
been
extremely
patient
with
me
as
I
tried
on
multiple
hats
in
search
of
the
right
costumes
for
my
magic
act
.
I
recommend
them
highly
!
DO
NT
ever
go
there
,
not
even
if
your
car
flips
.
Their
service
sucks
to
start
off
with
,
people
are
cruel
and
ignorant
.
I
'm
compeltly
dissatisfied
with
their
service
and
their
products
.
They
DO
NOT
have
a
return
policy
and
even
if
their
product
SUCKS
,
they
will
NOT
take
it
back
!
DO
NOT
EVER
GO
HERE
.
I
prefer
Advanced
auto
parts
over
this
crappy
place
with
the
meanest
people
.
And
they
THRIVE
to
get
a
customer
.
DO
NOT
go
here
..
thank
you
Horrible
I
have
been
growing
my
hair
out
for
1
year
plus
and
went
in
to
get
1
inch
taken
off
.
I
walked
out
with
5
inch
long
hair
on
the
top
,
2
inch
long
hair
on
the
sides
,
and
1.5
in
the
back
.
This
woman
should
be
working
in
supercuts
...
if
that
.
This
was
a
terrible
experience
and
I
hope
that
no
one
else
goes
through
that
.
Do
your
self
a
favor
and
do
not
go
to
this
establishment
.
I
generally
like
the
BK
over
the
other
fast
serving
restaurants
;
however
,
I
regreted
to
visit
this
restaurant
at
my
town
.
This
is
a
shame
of
my
adorable
town
,
Branford
.
I
ordered
a
kid
meal
with
a
milk
and
found
a
bottle
was
half
opened
already
.
I
asked
them
to
change
it
but
they
rudely
said
that
it
was
okay
.
Do
n't
go
,
or
you
will
learn
how
to
waste
your
money
.
Disappointed
The
Bad
:
I
was
at
Napa
recently
and
was
unpleasantly
surprised
at
poor
waiter
svce
and
subpar
food
.
We
were
a
party
of
4
and
none
of
us
were
particularly
pleased
with
our
dishes
.
Napa
is
all
about
wine
but
gives
very
short
descriptions
of
the
wines
on
their
lists
.
I
found
my
initial
selection
satisfactory
but
the
wine
flight
we
chose
to
be
poorly
composed
.
If
you
must
go
ask
lots
of
questions
about
your
selections
since
your
expectations
may
as
high
as
mine
were
.
Highly
Recommended
We
walked
in
to
pick
our
little
man
at
10
minutes
to
closing
and
heard
laughter
from
kids
and
the
staff
.
Their
sense
of
humour
and
calmness
when
dealing
with
the
little
ones
amazes
me
every
time
I
walk
in
.
We
have
since
moved
slightly
further
away
from
the
centre
but
it
's
worth
the
extra
travel
,
as
the
care
provided
exceeds
our
expectations
...
especially
after
a
few
horrendous
daycare
experiences
elsewhere
.
HORRIBLE
!!!!
!
The
crust
was
lopsided
,
thicker
on
one
side
than
the
other
.
It
actually
had
a
hole
in
one
of
the
slices
.
There
was
minimal
cheese
and
sauce
and
it
completely
lacked
flavor
.
I
know
New
York
pizza
and
this
is
not
it
!!
This
was
nothing
like
New
York
style
pizza
!!!.
I
love
pizza
and
this
was
a
complete
and
utter
disappointment
!!
I
would
not
suggest
this
pizza
to
anyone
!!!
They
came
to
my
house
in
no
time
and
started
working
on
the
gate
.
They
were
very
friendly
and
were
able
to
explain
me
exactly
what
was
wrong
with
it
.
You
will
be
happy
at
this
store
!
Allen
Tire
was
recommended
by
friend
after
my
having
bad
tire
experiences
in
Temecula
.
The
store
manager
,
Jim
Smith
,
made
an
excellent
tire
recommendation
for
my
newly
acquired
Lexus
.
Tires
were
the
right
price
and
now
the
car
feels
like
it
is
riding
on
rails
around
turns
.
The
store
is
clean
,
run
very
professionally
and
a
pleasure
to
be
in
.
They
know
their
job
and
you
do
not
have
to
watch
them
to
be
sure
everything
is
done
right
.
Very
kind
and
reliable
.
I
highly
recommend
this
dealership
if
you
would
not
like
to
hassle
on
price
and
receive
friendly
service
.
I
have
since
purchased
two
cars
from
this
dealership
,
The
first
one
was
from
Phillip
and
the
second
was
from
Richard
.
This
place
has
done
a
great
job
of
taking
care
of
the
usual
maintenance
on
my
hooptie
.
I
also
never
have
to
wait
long
for
a
yearly
inspection
sticker
...
and
never
get
the
usual
excuses
other
shops
always
gave
me
...
"
the
inspection
guy
is
n't
here
today
"
....
for
example
.
Today
I
went
into
Kwik
Kar
and
there
were
two
cars
in
front
of
me
for
inspection
...
but
I
was
still
out
of
there
pretty
quick
...
barely
had
time
to
read
a
chapter
in
my
book
.
Extremely
helpful
and
professional
As
first
-
time
home
buyers
,
my
husband
and
I
found
Stephanie
Fairchild
at
Prudential
Steamboat
Realty
,
extremely
helpful
.
She
worked
with
us
for
over
a
year
,
helping
us
find
our
perfect
home
.
Stephanie
's
knowledge
of
the
market
and
properties
in
our
price
range
,
made
us
feel
secure
in
our
decision
to
buy
when
we
did
.
We
would
highly
recommend
Stephanie
to
anyone
looking
for
a
home
in
the
Yampa
Valley
.
We
appreciated
her
patience
,
knowledge
and
kindness
!
Great
Barber
Firstly
,
the
other
reviewer
clearly
has
never
been
to
Nick
's
,
or
he
would
know
that
Nick
only
charges
$
13
for
a
haircut
which
is
pretty
much
industry
standard
.
I
have
been
going
to
Nick
for
5
months
now
precisely
because
he
does
pay
attention
to
detail
.
I
have
terrible
hair
and
he
really
takes
his
time
to
make
it
look
right
.
Some
of
the
younger
kids
that
work
there
are
a
bit
sub
par
,
but
if
you
wait
for
Nick
...
you
'll
be
good
.
UGH
!!!
Got
some
nice
"
freshly
baked
"
fruit
squares
,
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
.
Took
a
bite
,
it
tasted
odd
.
Flipped
the
square
over
and
saw
it
riddled
with
green
mold
!!!!
Ugh
!!
I
called
the
store
and
the
clerk
giggled
,
and
agreed
that
it
was
gross
,
but
said
it
was
not
her
problem
.
She
also
refused
to
get
a
manager
.
I
left
my
number
,
or
tried
to
anyway
.
Same
clerk
had
considerable
difficulty
taking
down
a
number
.
I
'll
never
go
back
there
again
For
cheap
Chinese
food
,
this
is
the
place
to
go
.
I
used
to
eat
at
places
like
New
China
or
Green
Buffet
in
Troy
,
MO
-
nothing
terrible
but
not
that
great
.
Now
,
I
wo
n't
eat
fast
food
Chinese
unless
it
's
from
this
place
.
Amazing
Experience
!
My
experience
was
amazing
at
Providence
Aesthetics
and
Medical
Spa
.
Jana
Kueck
was
nothing
but
professional
.
She
makes
you
feel
like
you
are
the
most
important
person
in
the
world
.
Jana
made
me
feel
very
comfortable
.
Provided
me
with
warm
blanket
and
has
soft
music
playing
.
Walking
in
the
door
you
are
made
to
feel
happy
and
relaxed
.
Equipment
is
state
of
the
art
.
I
would
reccomend
anyone
to
go
see
Jana
Kueck
and
Robin
Talley
to
see
all
the
many
procedures
they
have
to
offer
.
Dave
is
a
patient
and
methodical
teacher
,
who
has
a
great
ear
and
sensitivity
for
his
students
'
passion
and
the
direction
they
want
their
lessons
to
take
.
Also
,
he
loves
teaching
so
much
,
his
price
is
unbeatable
,
but
that
does
not
change
his
level
of
skill
.
Dave
has
much
to
offer

We
love
our
new
roof
!
We
would
like
to
thank
you
for
the
roofing
job
you
did
on
our
home
.
Everything
was
done
on
a
timely
manner
and
things
were
cleaned
and
picked
up
every
day
when
the
crew
was
done
.
We
also
liked
the
way
that
Ray
checked
on
the
job
every
day
.
And
when
the
job
was
done
every
thing
was
cleaned
up
and
hauled
off
that
same
day
.
We
would
not
hesitate
to
use
Spears
Roofing
again
.
We
have
already
recommended
you
to
some
of
our
friends
!
OMFG
I
FUCKING
HATE
THIS
PLACE
EVERY
TIME
i
GO
THIS
HOT
CHICK
SHOWS
UP
AND
i
MEAN
REALLY
HOT
BUT
SHE
IS
LIKE
REAAAALLY
DUMB
AND
THEN
THEIR
IS
THIS
OTHER
CHICK
THAT
IS
REALY
UGLY
BUT
SHE
IS
LIKE
SUPER
SMART
SHE
COULD
BE
A
SCIENTIST
,
BUT
THEN
THEIR
IS
THIS
STONER
WHO
ALWAYS
COMES
HERE
HIGH
AND
HE
ALWAYS
BRINGS
HIS
FUCKING
DOG
WHO
IS
SO
HIGH
FROM
THE
SECOND
HAND
SMOKE
I
THINK
HE
IS
TRYING
TO
TALK
.
AMAZINGLY
YUMMY
!
I
just
got
back
from
france
yesterday
and
just
missed
the
food
already
!
My
sister
in
law
told
me
about
this
amazing
new
crepe
place
in
town
,
I
was
so
excited
I
just
wanted
to
go
and
test
it
out
for
my
self
!
Their
customer
service
was
perfect
!
EVEN
IN
FRANCE
!
I
would
highly
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
looking
for
a
great
atmosphere
,
amazing
food
,
and
great
customer
service
!
Even
though
they
still
charge
you
the
days
you
booked
but
wo
n't
use
,
it
is
worth
the
get
the
hell
out
of
this
crap
hole
.
The
whole
experience
shows
a
hotel
managed
by
what
must
be
a
2
star
hotel
manager
.
Bad
service
starting
from
the
front
desk
.
Short
of
that
,
avoid
this
place
,
as
a
silver
Marriott
member
,
this
is
a
disgrace
.
I
lived
here
for
two
years
when
the
prices
were
a
little
lower
:)
The
places
are
very
nice
and
clean
,
and
in
great
condition
!
I
really
enjoyed
the
staff
at
Wessex
,
also
the
manager
Sherri
was
always
very
nice
and
helpful
.
The
fitness
center
was
GREAT
!
The
only
problem
that
I
had
in
2
years
of
living
there
was
that
the
walls
are
pretty
thin
,
sometimes
I
could
here
my
neighbors
conversations
.
I
would
recommend
these
apartments
to
anybody
!
I
absolutely
LOVED
living
there
.
My
car
broke
down
and
roadside
towed
my
vehicle
to
Sussman
Kia
.
They
squeezed
me
in
and
had
me
back
up
and
running
in
no
time
.
Everyone
was
pleasant
and
very
helpful
.
The
service
department
even
gave
me
a
ride
home
and
picked
me
up
when
my
car
was
finished
.
The
advisor
kept
me
up
to
date
and
informed
on
the
progress
of
my
vehicle
.
I
give
this
dealer
an
A
+
!
I
will
definitely
be
bringing
my
car
back
for
service
.

The
one
-
star
review
from
2005
is
out
of
date
.
There
was
a
change
of
ownership
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
service
is
both
quick
and
extremely
friendly
.
The
food
continues
to
be
very
good
--
deli
sandwiches
,
homemade
soups
,
fresh
salads
.
The
atmosphere
may
not
be
for
everyone
.
It
is
a
bustling
place
where
separate
parties
are
seated
at
the
same
table
(
as
in
many
European
cafes
)
,
but
if
you
are
OK
with
that
,
the
food
is
very
good
.
Love
the
soups
.

Another
Italian
restaurant
in
Collingswood
?
Do
we
need
another
one
?
Only
if
it
is
of
the
quality
of
That
's
Amore
.
The
menu
has
the
usual
but
then
they
step
it
up
another
notch
.
The
arancini
di
riso
(
risotto
fritters
)
are
not
to
be
missed
.
Pay
extra
attention
to
the
appetizers
-
the
next
time
I
go
there
I
'm
planning
on
ordered
a
few
instead
of
an
entree
.
The
first
time
I
used
them
they
arrived
on
time
and
towed
car
for
me
to
the
destination
I
needed
.
The
auto
mechanics
that
work
for
Auto
Towing
are
very
friendly
and
informative
and
answered
any
question
I
had
.
They
have
towed
car
for
me
a
few
times
and
I
am
always
very
satisfied
with
this
services
.
If
you
are
looking
for
towing
services
that
can
offer
you
a
good
towed
car
service
,
then
Auto
Towing
is
the
company
for
you
.

As

I
wholeheartedly
recommend
United
Air
Duct
Cleaning
.
They
are
professional
,
knowledgeable
,
and
take
meticulous
care
and
pride
in
accomplishing
their
work
.
Not
only
were
my
wife
and
I
very
pleased
,
but
I
also
had
the
air
duct
quality
tested
professionally
by
the
home
inspector
that
I
regularly
use
,
before
and
after
United
Air
Duct
performed
their
work
.
Based
on
the
test
results
,
the
home
inspector
stated
that
the
quality
of
their
job
was
â€œ
excellent
â€
.

with
style
.
If
you
've
been
to
North
County
,
chances
are
it
's
in
your
favorites
list
already
.
They
were
very
professional
,
respectful
,
completed
the
Job
on
time
,
and
well
below
my
budget
.
Mike
one
of
owners
was
awesome
,
he
explained
the
detailed
plan
,
and
executed
on
time
,
I
am
always
going
use
them
and
refer
them
to
many
friends
I
can
because
of
the
great
job
they
did
me
.
Great
Dude
Cut
!
Great
service
,
cool
vibe
,
impeccable
style
.
I
'm
a
guy
with
tricky
hair
so
getting
that
right
is
job
#
1
.
After
going
through
5
other
places
I
finally
found
Janice
at
Alta
Moda
.
Either
I
suck
at
my
own
style
or
Janice
is
a
genius
.
Looks
like
there
's
a
lot
of
talent
in
this
place
.
Worth
every
penny
.
My
Favorite
place
at
Wildwood
I
have
been
going
to
the
Wildwood
,
NJ
for
over
30
years
for
summer
vacations
and
always
call
the
Madrid
first
.
I
rated
it
5
stars
.
I
am
not
saying
it
is
a
5
star
hotel
.
I
am
saying
when
comparing
all
other
hotels
in
Wildwood
,
this
hotel
has
everything
that
we
are
looking
for
.
It
is
the
hospitality
from
Tom
and
staff
,
that
makes
it
feel
like
a
5
star
hotel
in
the
middle
of
the
beach
.
We
prefer
the
layout
of
rooms
and
it
is
always
clean
.
When
in
Scordia
,
Sicily
If
ever
in
Sicily
please
take
the
time
to
visit
Anna
Maria
Jose
Mudo
and
her
familia
.
They
are
and
always
will
be
the
nicest
people
in
Sicily
that
you
will
meet
.
You
will
also
have
the
pleasure
of
learning
the
Italiano
language
.
I
've
never
felt
the
need
to
write
a
review
or
make
a
complaint
before
,
but
after
the
way
I
was
spoken
to
by
a
member
of
staff
at
the
kennels
(
whose
name
I
believe
to
be
Mrs
Closs
)
I
would
now
not
recommend
this
business
to
anybody
.
If
the
animals
are
treated
in
the
same
way
the
customers
are
treated
then
this
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
!
They
were
very
patient
and
helpful
from
showing
the
cars
to
doing
the
paperwork
.
The
paperwork
was
a
very
easy
and
smooth
.
They
tried
to
run
my
credit
score
as
less
as
possible
so
it
wo
n't
hurt
my
score
.
Overall
,
I
was
very
happy
with
the
customer
service
and
my
purchase
.
If
you
're
looking
to
buy
a
car
,
definitely
give
them
a
call
.
They
have
a
huge
inventory
.
I
have
been
a
patient
a
NW
hospital
and
it
was
great
.
Yes
,
we
had
to
wait
,
but
ER
is
a
triage
system
that
takes
the
most
life
threatening
cases
first
.
Any
ER
would
be
the
same
.
As
far
as
being
treated
like
a
drug
seeker
,
that
has
not
been
my
experience
.
As
a
nurse
I
know
about
drug
seekers
.
Wonderful
Experience
I
had
immense
pain
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
with
friends
and
family
telling
me
that
I
would
never
find
a
Dentist
on
a
Sunday
.
Dr.
Taylor
was
not
only
available
on
a
Sunday
,
but
also
was
able
to
immediately
take
care
of
me
.
He
really
made
the
visit
a
pain
free
one
with
excellent
service
!
I
would
recommend
him
to
everyone
!
HORRIBLE
I
attended
it
for
2
years
,
and
that
was
enough
.
There
's
holes
everywhere
in
the
ceiling
,
sewage
constantly
leaks
through
the
ceiling
,
and
the
whole
condition
of
the
school
is
horrible
.
The
education
is
horrible
at
best
,
do
society
a
favor
,
and
do
NOT
send
your
student
here
.
Excellent
customer
service
and
quality
work
.
They
went
the
extra
mile
to
repair
my
cowboy
boots
--
they
had
to
have
a
special
kind
of
paper
that
looked
like
wood
grain
to
fix
the
heels
.
That
was
4
years
ago
.
I
have
n't
been
able
to
find
a
shoe
repair
place
in
Seattle
since
that
has
been
able
to
do
it
.
(
I
've
been
through
at
least
5
places
already
.
)
If
I
had
time
to
drive
to
Tacoma
before
they
closed
during
the
work
week
,
I
would
just
so
I
could
get
those
boots
fixed
properly
again
.
So
Handy
for
Local
La
Jolla
Stuff
-
Especially
for
Finding
Residential
Numbers
Since
moving
back
from
college
and
trying
to
settle
roots
in
the
Village
,
I
have
referred
to
the
La
Jolla
Blue
Book
for
a
ton
of
local
numbers
.
The
white
pages
allowed
me
to
get
in
touch
with
parents
of
my
high
school
friends
so
that
I
could
track
people
down
one
by
one
and
the
restaurant
section
is
basically
my
cookbook
.
It
's
really
cool
that
so
many
local
businesses
are
found
so
quickly
in
one
place
and
I
want
to
spread
the
word
.
The
staff
do
occasionally
get
game
info
correct
,
but
if
you
r
looking
fot
a
good
game
and
are
n't
a
nerd
,
do
nt
ask
them
.
The
last
time
I
did
that
I
was
suggested
to
buy
oblivion
when
I
told
them
I
was
looking
for
a
fps
.
I
knew
what
it
was
and
told
the
guy
that
it
was
n't
a
fps
.
He
tried
to
tell
me
it
was
when
I
told
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
fps
stood
for
and
he
had
no
clue
.
First
and
Last
time
we
'll
eat
there
My
friend
and
I
went
there
for
lunch
today
.
Neither
one
of
us
had
ever
been
-
so
we
thought
we
'd
try
it
.
BIG
MISTAKE
-
The
food
was
tasteless
and
cold
.
We
both
kept
trying
to
find
something
we
liked
.
Would
NOT
recommend
this
place
to
anyone
-
in
fact
-
save
your
money
and
go
somewhere
else
.
Liquidweb.com
Rocks
!!!
I
am
not
a
client
of
liquidweb.com
,
but
one
of
my
friend
called
Steven
is
the
client
having
several
websites
.
I
work
with
him
and
since
past
6
years
he
is
hosting
his
websites
to
Liquidweb
.
The
kind
of
support
they
provide
is
simply
great
!!!
I
would
like
to
host
my
upcoming

simple
but
perfect
IF
you
want
flashy
fancy
food
stacked
high
with
lots
of
fussy
garnishes
,
this
is
not
the
place
for
you
.
If
you
want
perfectly
executed
simple
dishes
that
feature
a
few

ingredients
,

I
've
dined
at
lots
of
high
-
end
restaurants
and
I
've
never
before
felt
my
money
was
so
well
spent
.
Great
Prices
,
Great
service
!
I
've
been
to
this
shop
twice
(
once
for
an
inspection
and
again
for
an
oil
change
)
and
they
truly
live
up
to
their
name
:
Discount
!
They
have
all
kind
of
coupons
available
for
car
washes
,
oil
changes
,
state
inspection
,
etc
.
The
thing
is
,
you
still
get
high
quality
service
at
nicely
discounted
rates
!
There
is
even
free
coffee
and
bottles
of
water
if
you
'd
like
.
The
owner
is
a
pleasant
guy
and
I
would
trust
my
car
with
him
or
any
of
his
workers
.
Top
notch
,
all
the
way
!
David
is
amazing
David
is
the
most
helpful
and
creative
photographer
that
I
have
used
.
He
is
willing
to
do
whatever
you
need
from
him
without
hesitation
.
He
was
patient
and
adapted
when
everything
did
n't
go
according
to
schedule
on
my
wedding
day
.
Both
the
engagement
and
wedding
pictures
that
he
took
for
us
we
absolutely
amazing
.
He
got
the
pictures
back
to
me
quickly
.
I
would
highly
recommend
David
to
anyone
.
He
will
exceed
your
expectations
!
He
does
n't
just
take
pictures
he
makes
art
out
of
them
and
you
wo
n't
even
notice
that
there
's
a
camera
there
.
Not
so
great
My
husband
just
got
a
bike
there
as
a
gift
he
's
only
had
it
a
month
.
It
's
a
nice
bike
and
it
cost
a
lot
of
money
.
He
took
it
back
and
they
would
not
honor
a
warranty
and
said
it
was
his
fault
because
of
his
shoes
??
Which
was
very
expensive
.
He
asked
for
a
different
pair
instead
and
they
only
gave
him
five
dollars
off
??
Trek
is
not
so
great
Only
Concerned
With
Money
The
people
there
attempt
to
come
across
and
professional
and
nice
,
but
I
was
disappointed
with
their
customer
service
.
Never
miss
an
appointment
because
they
will
charge
you
the
price
of
a
treatment
,
even
if
you
had
an
emergency
.
It
's
pretty
ridiculous
!
They
want
to
squeeze
as
much
as
they
can
from
you
even
if
you
just
got
in
a
car
accident
!!!!
They
do
n't
care
one
bit
about
you
!!!!!
Terrible
service
!!!
Made
an
appointment
to
have
them
come
to
the
house
to
discuss
curtain
options
and
give
an
estimate
.
They
sent
over
someone
who
said
he
knows
nothing
about
curtains
and
could
not
show
me
fabric
options
or
give
an
estimate
.
Instead
of
rescheduling
they
chose
to
waste
my
time
instead
.
So
what
was
the
point
of
the
appointment
!?!
To
just
come
over
and
hang
out
?!?
I
will
NEVER
do
business
with
this
company
!
EVER
!!!
Internet
Department
is
rude
and
insulting
I
was
looking
to
bring
a
customer
to
their
lot
to
buy
a
car
but
the
Internet
salesperson
Last
name
is
Balazick
sent
me
this
email
"
AND
IF
IT
WAS
WORTH
MY
TIME
I
WOULD
OF
BOTHERED
ASWERING
YOUR
QUESTIONS
.
I
MAKE
MONEY
NOT
DEAL
WITH
BROKERS
"
Wow
,
can
you
believe
in
today
s
tough
times
this
dealership
would
be
looking
for
any
way
to
move
vehicles
.
As
a
previous
Internet
Manager
I
would
deal
with
anyone
looking
to
buy
a
car
for
a
profit
and
not
care
if
they
came
in
with
a
broker
.
Stay
away
from
this
dealership
!!!
This
place
is
a
Rip
-
Off
I
brought
a
car
in
to
have
the
"
check
engine
"
light
diagnosed
back
in
March
of
2010
.
They
said
it
was
"
plugs
and
wires
"
and
quoted
me
$
330
to
do
the
work
,
including
parts
.
I
asked
why
so
high
and
they
said
it
was
due
to
the
labor
of
moving
things
out
of
the
way
.
I
did
the
work
myself
for
$
50
.
There
's
no
excuse
for
that
kind
of
estimate
.
My
girlfriend
and
I
took
a
chance
on
this
place
because
we
did
n't
want
to
wait
in
line
at
Outback
.
What
an
amazing
find
-
this
restaurant
is
a
GEM
.
#
1
it
s
immaculately
clean
.
#
2
the
decor
is
tasteful
and
artistic
,
from
the
comfortable
chairs
to
the
elegant
light
fixtures
....
and
(
most
importantly
)
#
3
the
food
is
FANTASTIC
.
This
is
authentic
Cuban
cuisine
;
fresh
ingredients
expertly
prepared
and
seasoned
perfectly
.
The
portions
were
generous
and
we
got
out
for
less
than
the
cost
of
one
entree
at
some
chain
restaurant
.
TRY
THIS
PLACE
-
YOU
'LL
LOVE
IT
.
Thank
you
for
helping
me
get
more
healthy
!
I
came
in
and
saw
Dr.
Ruona
about
a
month
ago
for
quitting
smoking
.
I
have
to
tell
you
that
I
have
n't
had
one
and
do
n't
want
one
.
I
sent
a
customer
of
mine
to
you

Dr.
Ruona

if
you

thank
you
for
helping

feel
that
I
have
more
possibilities
open
to
me
now
than
I
did
before

I
ca
n't
thank
you
enough

I
would
appreciate

in
the
mental
health
setting
.
Fantastic
for
kids
It
's
only
$
10
and
in
essence
just
one
big
petting
zoo
.
They
sell
feed
and
milk
bottles
at
the
front
and
I
recommend
you
buy
lots
.
We
took
our
7
month
old
and
she
laughed
and
giggled
when
(
very
harshly
I
might
add
)
grabbing
and
'
kissed
'
the
goats
and
lambs
.
The
animals
were
all
very
sweet
and
patient
with
her
.
Wonderful
,
inexpensive
and
lots
of
fun
!
WOW
!!!
I
ca
n't
say
enough
good
things
about
Karla
and
the
wonderful
things
she
has
done
for
me
and
my
dog
Gracee
.
Gracee
is
more
excited
to
see
her
than
she
is
excited
to
see
me
!!!!
She
has
always
been
there
for
Gracee
even
for
last
minute
calls
!
She
has
taken
care
of
my
sweet
girl
for
almost
4
years
now
and
I
would
not
let
Gracee
go
with
anyone
besides
her
!!!
She
is
caring
,
punctual
,
and
very
enthusiastic
about
her
job
!
You
should
give
her
a
try
-
it
's
worth
every
penny
to
know
that
you
pet
is
in
GREAT
hands
with
Wunderbar
pet
sitting
!!!!
I
wish
there
was
something
good
to
say
about
the
business
,
but
unfortunately
,
there
is
n't
.
1
)
Service
and
manners
were
nonexistent
.
(
to
both
myself
and
customers
)
3
)
I
have
never
experienced
so
much
rudeness
coming
from
a
business
.
4
)
The
business
is
very
unorganized
.
The
invoice
is
not
detailed
,
so
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
you
are
paying
for
.
I
'd
recommend
to
save
your
time
and
energy
and
find
another
greek
store
.
Exile
is
the
longest
lasting
and
most
authentic
punk
store
in
Richmond
!
I
have
been
shopping
there
for
over
six
years
now
.
The
staff
is
incredibly
friendly
and
helpful
and
the
owner
,
Mimmy
,
is
an
absolute
angel
.
The
mark
up
is
minimal
considering
that
the
clothing
is
hard
to
find
and
often
shipped
for
Europe
.
Exile
is
environmentally
conscious
and

Over-rated
Buddakan
inevitably
attracts
the
majority
of
its
guests
simply
because
of
its
association
with
Steven
Starr
,
but
that
does
n't
impress
me
.
The
atmosphere
alone
deserves
4
stars
but
,
the
food
was
not
up
to
par
with
the
price
tag
and
the
reputation
the
restaurant
carries
.
The
server
we
had
was
knowledgeable
but
he
was
not
as
proper
as
he
should
have
been
,
acting
like
he
was
talking
to
his
friends
rather
than
his
customers
.
The
angry
lobster
was
completely
over-priced
!
$
80
for
a
dish
that
has
about
one
small
lobster
tail
and
is
full
of
filler
vegetables
!
I
would
n't
go
there
again
.
Alto
delivers
on
all
levels
.
From
the
moment
you
enter
the
restaurant
,
you
know
you
are
some
place
special
.
I
highly
recommend
the
four
-
course
tasting
menu
,
which
gives
you
plenty
of
range
and
food
to
satisfy
your
appetite
.
Also
,
if
you
are
into
wine
,
Alto
has
the
depth
of
both
region
,
varietal
,
and
vintage
to
satisfy
nearly
any
sommelier
(
or
after
9
pm
,
bring
your
own
bottle
for
free
...
no
corking
fee
!
)
.
While
it
's
not
cheap
,
Alto
will
give
you
an
experience
you
'll
never
forget
.
The
landlord
is
not
nice
nor
helpful
I
love
the
location
and
the
apartment
!!
I
'm
a
single
female
and
I
feel
safe
coming
home
at
night
.
The
maintenance
people
are
AWESOME
!!!!
And
the
exterminator
is
very
nice
,
also
.
Yes
,
you
still
have
a
few
bugs
,
but
that
's
going
to
be
anywhere
you
go
!
The
only
problem
that
I
have
experienced
is
the
landlord
.
I
know
that
's
ugly
...
but
she
wo
n't
help
you
out
for
anything
...
sad
story
.
Other
than
that
,
I
would
recommend
living
here
.
:)
The
staff
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
.
The
front
staff
has
seen
quite
a
bit
of
turnover
and
changed
from
professional
to
rude
.
A
simple
follow
-
up
phone
call
with
a
woman
quickly
turned
into
a
nightmare
.
She
may
be
the
reason
for
all
the
change
.
I
sincerely
wonder
if
the
doctor
has
a
clue
about
what
is
going
on
within
his
practice
.
If
he
does
know
and
approves
of
this
behavior
then
it
is
a
poor
reflection
on
him
.
Sometimes
it
is
not
worth
it
to
go
through
that
kind
of
staff
and
their
personal
attitude
to
get
to
a
doctor
.
He
was
an
okay
doctor
but
not
worth
her
.

Wonderful
Wild
Wildernest
inn
I
would
give
the
Wildernest
inn
ten
stars
of
five
!
Atop
Spring
Mountain
,
from
the
decks
of
the
West
porch
,
"
one
can
see
forever
"
a
scene
of
unparalleled
beauty
and
grandeur
.
I
saw
deer
frequently
,
in
fact
a
small
herd
were
grazing
near
the
lodge
.
There
were
occasional
bears
on
the
deck
in
the
morning
.
and
most
correctly
,
us
visitors
did
not
mingle
with
the
native
wildlife
.
It
would
have
been
more
than
one
could
bear
!
Delightful
,
hospitable
,
superb
,
cozy
and
comfortable
.
I
hope
to
be
back
!
junkie
lube
?!
really
weird
place
,
I
was
driving
home
from
work
thought
I
'd
stop
in
for
an
oil
change
and
well
,
there
are
a
few
guys
in
jiffy
lube
uniforms
sitting
at
the
table
drinking
beers
and
shooting
the
breeze
.
I
asked
if
a
manager
was
on
duty
he
told
me
he
was
.
WOW
!
A
friend
and
I
recently
took
our
16
and
18
month
olds
here
.
While
there
was
n't
too
much
available
for
their
age
(
ball
pit
,
bouncy
area
and
a
little
padded
pyramid
to
climb
on
)
,
we
went
right
when
they
opened
at
10
am
on
a
winter
weekday
and
ended
up
being
the
only
ones
there
,
so
we
were
given
a
little
more
liberty
than
we
would
have
if
others
had
been
there
.
It
's
not
the
classiest
place
,
but
it
was
cleaner
than
I
expected
and
the
staff
was
very
friendly
.
For
$
4
it
was
a
nice
break
from
the
monotony
of
winter
indoors
with
a
toddler
.
I
spent
3
months
going
from
shop
to
shop
trying
to
get
my
Ferrari
to
run
and
drive
the
way
it
should
.
I
was
about
to
give
up
when
I
met
Jason
and
Neal
.
They
took
on
the
challenge
of
making
my
Ferrari
all
I
dreamed
of
and
more
.
The
crew
at
The
Creative
Workshop
went
over
and
above
the
call
of
duty
and
gave
me
back
a
car
I
can
drive
anywhere
and
finally
enjoy
owning
.
I
can
not
say
enough
about
this
place
.
They
have
restored
my
faith
in
Mechanics
.
Do
yourself
a
favor
,
call
these
guys
first
and
enjoy
driving
your
car
again
..
a
great
vacation
!
We
wanted
to
see
the
sun
-
and
we
also
got
much
more
!
Excellent
chefs
are
in
the
kitchen
preparing
memorable
breakfasts
.
After
a
train
ride
over
the
mountains
,
we
enjoyed
hiking
in
the
flower
-
filled
Wenatchee
hills
(
in
May
)
and
a
very
interesting
bike
ride
in
a
loop
around
the
Columbia
River
...
and
then
wine
if
we
wanted
it
on
the
patio
in
the
evening
....
OMG
OMG
..
make
sure
to
book
a
reservation
,
as
this
magical
place
is
packed
(
in
a
nice
way
)
I
love
that
the
owner
walks
around
and
cares
how
his
customers
feel
about
their
food
.
The
food
was
finger
licking
the
bowel
fantastic
..
I
have
lived
in
the
UTC
La
Jolla
area
for
many
years
,
and
I
never
new
this
salon
was
here
until
a
friend
reffered
me
to
see
Holly
here
.
I
was
very
pleased
with
my
experience
here
.
All
of
the
people
were
friendly
and
welcoming
.
I
got
highlights
,
haircut
,
and
a
blowdry
.
She
did
a
great
job
!
Holly
is
very
experienced
and
talented
,
and
I
could
tell
she
new
what
she
was
doing
right
off
the
bat
.
My
hair
looks
amazing
,
and
I
get
compliments
all
the
time
.
I
deffenitly
reccomend
this
salon
and
Holly
to
anyone
.
You
will
not
be
disappointed
!!!!!!
Outdated
but
not
bad
So
I
really
felt
like
this
place
was
extremely
outdated
especially
since
the
pictures
make
it
look
nice
and
modern
.
It
had
listed
that
there
was
a
hot
breakfast
but
all
this
meant
is
that
they
added
a
waffle
maker
to
the
common
continental
affair
at
most
cheap
hotels
.
The
family
suite
was
basically
two
rooms
with
a
small
opening
between
them
which
worked
great
for
us
because
we
were
two
families
traveling
together
.
If
you
are
in
town
and
need
that
kind
of
space
I
say
stay
here
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
little
more
upscale
affair
do
n't
let
the
pictures
fool
you
and
book
somewhere
else
.
Great
,
and
probably
the
only
West
Indian
spot
worth
hitting
up
in
Nashville
.
I
was
born
and
raised
in
Toronto
,
which
has
a
huge
West
Indian
(
Trinidadian
,
Jamaican
,
etc
)
population
.
Anyway
,
I
was
practically
raised
on
this
stuff
,
and
being
a
connoisseur
of
West
Indian
cuisine
,
Jamaica
Way
is
a
bit
toned
down
to
suit
the
American
palette
.
All
you
have
to
do
to
make
it
authentic
Jamaican
food
,
is
add
a
whole
lot
of
pepper
.
A
lot
.
The
finest
Christmas
Trees
i
've
ever
seen
.
I
felt
like
I
was
in
heaven
when
I
walked
through
the
majestic
fields
of
this
particular
farm
.
The
trees
were
in
magnificent
shape
and
the
variety
was
astounding
.
The
owners
were
entertaining
and
gracious
.
I
especially
liked
the
Eco
friendly
atmosphere
and
the
owner
s
love
of
all
animals
.
I
would
call
it
the
Taj
Mahal
of
the
east
coast
!
It
put
hair
on
my
chest
and
thanks
to
the
owner
s
advice
I
invested
vanguard
,
got
myself
a
woman
like
Jerry
,
and
became
a
republican
.
Thanks

I
have
been
eating
Pho
for
almost
my
entire
life
and
I
've
always
gone
to
the
Pho
places
in
south
philly
and
off
the
boulevard
and
even
the
other
one
in
chinatown
,
but
when
i
tried
this
pho
place
,
it
blew
the
other
pho
houses
away
!!
all
of
the
pho
places
taste
the
same
to
me
,
so
what
seperates
one
from
the
other
is
the
service
and
the
price
.
The
service
here
is
incredible
compared
to
the
other
places
.
the
only
down
fall
of
this
pho
house
is
the
difficulty
in
finding
parking
in
chinatown
.
remember
to
bring
cash
since
they
do
n't
take
debit
or
credit
.
hope
this
helps
!!
Had
a
horrible
experience
with
a
manager
here
,
Rachel
McInnis
,
she
was
rude
,
inconsiderate
and
did
not
do
the
right
thing
for
an
item
that
was
marked
incorrectly
...
I
'm
not
interested
in
shopping
in
a
place
with
people
like
her
...
she
refused
to
sell
me
the
item
at
its
marked
price
even
after
admitting
they
had
made
a
mistake
.
It
's
never
ok
to
let
a
customer
walk
out
unhappy
,
especially
when
they
are
right
.
Highly
Recommend
I
work
as
a
Transformational
Life
Coach
.
I
found
her
through
a
colleague
one
day
when
one
of
my
clients
was
in
the
midst
of
a
panic
attack
and
needed
professional
help
that
I
am
not
qualified
to
provide
.
Little
did
I
know
that
I
would
soon
be
needing
her
help
as
well
!
She
guided
me
through
a
very
difficult
period
dealing
with
a
family
member
's
suicide
,
coupled
with
elder
abuse
.
I
found
her
to
be
extremely
solid
,
kind
,
compassionate
,
and
intuitive
as
well
.
I
would
recommend
her
highly
!
They
wo
n't
have
a
second
chance
from
me
.
First
,
let
me
state
that
although
I
live
in
NYC
,
I
am
not
from
NYC
,
I
do
n't
care
about
baseball
and
I
absolutely
love
Boston
to
death
(
so
beautiful
,
so
clean
,
so
awesome
)
.
That
said
,
I
hated
this
restaurant
.
The
service
was
just
about
as
good
as
I
'd
get
in
NYC
(
that
means
it
was
poor
)
and
the
food
was
almost
mediocre
.
The
decor
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
and
the
posters
telling
me
all
the
reasons
99
was
great
just
served
as
an
ironic
contrast
against
the
reality
.
Personally
I
recommend
you
take
your
money
elsewhere
When
I
arrived
at
Brickell
Honda
on
6/4/11
,
I
was
greeted
and
attended
to
by
the
Sales
Manager
,
Gustavo
Guerra
,
in
a
very
friendly
and
professional
manner
.
I
explained
to
him
what
I
wanted
and
that
I
previously
went
to
Braman
Honda
.
He
told
me
"
no
problem
,
we
will
match
the
offer
or
do
better
.
"
I
urge
all
St.
Thomas
the
Apostle
parishioners
and
all
of
South
Florida
residents
to
come
see
Gus
!!!
Excellent
customer
service
!!!
Great
,
Honest
Service
I
took
my
2001
Nissan
Frontier
in
to
fix
a
cracked
manifold
.
The
dealer
wanted
$
1300
to
fix
that
and
another
$
1500
to
fix
some
other
things
.
I
was
so
impressed
with
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
Mike
and
everyone
at
Eagle
Transmission
!
I
dropped
the
truck
off
in
the
morning
and
it
was
ready
that
afternoon
.
I
have
finally
found
a
mechanic
I
trust
!!
And
it
was
great
that
they
did
not
charge
a
service
fee
to
diagnose
the
problem
-
an
added
bonus
!!
Dr.
Shady
Kelly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.
Dr.
Shady
is
a
jerk
.
After
the
way
she
spoke
to
me
on
my
last
visit
,
I
will
not
be
returning
!!
Good
luck
keeping
business
with
that
stuck
up
attitude
Dr.
Shady
.
You
have
just
lost
mine
.
The
next
time
you
feel
like
being
condescending
to
someone
,
it
is
not
going
to
be
me
!!!!!!
Dr.
Shady
is
inexperienced
and
prideful
.
She
probably
does
not
even
have
10
%
of
the
knowledge
that
some
of
the
other
EXPERIENCED
vets
do
in
this
area
.
I
will
be
carefully
researching
vets
before
I
take
my
dog
someplace
else
.
Beautifully
written
reviews
Doctor
,
but
completely
UNTRUE
.
Poor
Experience
I
did
not
have
a
good
experience
w
/
Dr.
Ghassemlou
.
During
the
session
,
he
demanded
to
have
my
physical
address
,
which
I
've
always
kept
private
as
I
am
enrolled
in
a
witness
protection
program
.
I
believe
he
is
correct
in
that
he
needs
my
physical
address
for
legal
reasons
,
however
,
he
did
not
adequately
explain
this
during
our
session
.
I
learned
more
about
this
doing
my
own
research
afterward
.
I
think
he
could
've
done
more
to
assuage
my
concerns
by
giving
me
concrete
facts
.
Saying
that
I
need
to
give
him
my
address
or
else
I
have
intimacy
issues
is
not
helpful
.
It
's
pretty
combative
actually
.
you
'll
love
it
I
have
had
my
back
fused
in
2
places
.
I
wish
that
I
had
n't
done
this
.
Even
after
my
fusions
,
my
back
continued
to
hurt
,
but
now
it
does
n't
hurt
any
more
.
I
would
encourage
anyone
who
is
thinking
of
back
surgery
,
to
talk
about
different
treatment
options
first
with
Dr.
de
Barros
.
He
really
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
and
will
approach
the
different
options
fairly
.
Unbelievably
huge
experience
for
such
a
small
salon
!!!
I
have
been
to
Kim
at
Cheveux
for
more
than
five
years
.
I
can
not
tell
you
how
often
I
am
complimented
on
my
hair
(
style
AND
color
)
!
I
regularly
request
Kim
's
business
cards
as
I
am
often
stopped
on
the
street
and
asked
"
Who
does
your
hair
...
I
LOVE
it
!!!
"
Quaint
,
lovely
,
small
salon
with
BIG
personality
.
I
am
made
to
feel
special
when
I
am
in
the
chair
and
I
have
NEVER
had
a
less
than
amazing
cut
or
color
experience
.
My
hair
has
never
felt
this
healthy
,
either
.
I
can
not
recommend
this
salon
enough
!!!
Thanks

My
Favorite
in
McLean
My
family
loves
coming
to
Endo
Sushi
.
They
are
very
nice
,
it
is
never
crowded
,
and
the
food
is
wonderful
,
very
delicious
and
fresh
!
Sometimes
it
is
hard
to
get
parking
in
the
lot
in
front
of
the
storefront
,
and
it
is
on
a
one
-
way
street
,
but
the
restaurant
itself
is
NEVER
overcrowded
.
If
you
can
not
park
in
the
lot
,
then
you
can
park
in
the
shopping
center
's
garage
,
and
walk
up
to
Endo
Sushi
.
The
service
is
fast
.
Be
sure
to
ring
the
little
bell
on
your
way
out
if
you
enjoyed
your
meal
!
(
it
's
by
the
door
,
on
the
hostess
stand
)
Horrible
Service
!
I
got
yelled
at
,
literally
yelled
at
because
i
asked
if
i
could
pick
up
my
car
5
-
10
minutes
late
.
I
explained
that
i
was
already
on
my
way
and
i
would
rush
to
get
there
as
soon
as
i
could
because
i
needed
my
car
for
work
at
5
am
,
but
the
guy
was
arguing
with
me
saying
he
was
gon
na
lock
the
doors
right
at
5:30
.
Rude
,
unprofessional
,
just
jerks
.
Seems
like
all
they
care
about
is
the
money
and
getting
home
on
time
,
NO
care
for
the
customers
AT
ALL
!!!
Missed
a
whole
day
of
work
because
i
am
now
carless
.
I
will
NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR
go
to
this
place
again
.
Superb
Arrangements
I
am
so
glad
that
I
called
in
to
see
Ana
,
she
is
a
lovely
girl
who
showed
nothing
but
care
and
compassion
towards
me
.
The
flowers
were
all
that
I
hoped
they
would
be
,
I
have
attended
several
funerals
of
late
unfortunately
and
the
flowers
I
recieved
from
Ana
outshone
them
all
.
She
is
so
talented
,
the
flowers
were
arranged
superbly
and
delicately
,
it
is
so
obvious
to
see
the
difference
between
someone
fully
trained
and
skilled
compared
to
others
.
Great
first
experience
.
I
'm
22
,
and
my
hairdresser
was
great
(
and
not
"
old
"
like
one
of
the
reviews
says
)
-
she
really
listened
to
what
I
wanted
and
gave
me
tons
of
tips
on
how
to
style
my
hair
so
I
could
get
it
to
look
the
way
I
wanted
it
to
.
She
deep
conditioned
my
hair
and
took
the
time
to
style
it
properly
.
She
recommended
products
but
absolutely
did
n't
pressure
me
to
buy
.
It
's
a
cute
place
with
a
really
friendly
,
laid
-
back
atmosphere
.
I
would
highly
recommend
it
and
will
be
going
back
for
my
next
haircut
.
Oh
!
And
students
get
$
5
off
,
ca
n't
argue
with
that
.
Smoker
s
Haven
Yeah
,
this
complex
is
not
very
good
.
Our
bathroom
fan
,
one
electric
outlet
and
2
leaky
sinks
have
yet
to
be
fixed
.
Both
bathrooms
look
like
they
were
flooded
and
the
wood
cabinets
are
thrashed
at
the
bottom
and
they
slapped
some
pieces
of
wood
over
to
try
to
cover
it
up
.
I
think
90
percent
of
the
tenants
are
smokers
!
If
you
do
not
smoke
,
do
not
move
here
.
Our
unit
reeks
of
old
cigarette
smoke
and
it
started
to
become
apparent
a
few
weeks
after
we
moved
in
.
I
used
to
go
here
almost
every
day
since
I
work
in
the
neighbourhood
and
loved
their
turkey
and
meatball
sandwiches
.
Chicken
salad
salad
is
great
too
.
The
staff
get
to
know
regulars
and
do
their
job
very
well
.
Tourists
like
the
other
reviewer
might
not
appreciate
their
efficiency
or
quality
,
but
I
certainly
do
.
This
is
n't
a
TGIF
or
Cafe
,
it
s
a
lunch
sandwich
place
and
a
good
one
at
that
.
Rate
a
church
?
Might
as
well
just
hotpot
the
curb
and
rate
the
traffic
light
.
Big
,
grey
and
imposing
.
The
pastor
at
this
church
is
cool
,
I
met
him
after
some
holiday
service
.
God
was
pleased
with
that
one
!
Stop
by
at
least
once
or
you
'll
go
to
heck
!
ok
but
just
becuse
we
where
on
a
tight
budget
.
i
'm
a
red
sox
fan
so
i
was
glad
that
the
phillies
won
.
but
sice
we
almost
just
slept
there
i
ca
nt
give
that
good
of
a
review
It
was
a
Saturday
and
my
spring
was
broken
...
I
googled
Garage
Door
Repair
in
Woodinville
and
found
NDI
-
Johnette
answered
the
phone
and
was
oh
-
so
pleasant
and
helpful
!
She
sort
of
appologized
for
Dan
taking
the
day
off
to
go
skiing
-
but
he
could
do
the
repair
on
Sunday
!
I
said
great
and
Dan
arrived
on
time
at
10
am
to
make
the
repair
.
I
enjoyed
speaking
with
Dan
,
and
learning
more
about
how
the
springs
are
sized
for
these
doors
.
The
repair
went
quickly
and
the
price
was
extremely
fair
.
I
would
highly
recommend
NDI
-
and
will
spread
the
word
to
my
neighbors
.
Thanks
Dan
and
Johnette
for
your
responsiveness
and
professional
service
.
Roger
M.
,
Woodinville
I
would
n't
send
my
dogs
there
.
I
had
a
conversation
with
the
woman
running
this
place
in
April
2010
.
Wow
,
really
?
REAL
CHRISTIAN
OF
YOU
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whether
they
pay
me
or
not
,
if
their
parents
get
into
an
accident
,
stuck
in
traffic
,
etc.
THE
LAST
THING
I
WOULD
DO
IS
LET
A
CHILD
GET
RAPED
BECAUSE
I
WAS
N'T
PAID
.
Excellent
service
I
could
easily
go
to
Nordstrom
for
my
designer
jeans
and
pay
the
same
price
,
but
I
go
to
the
Garment
District
for
their
service
.
Previous
reviewers
said
they
were
pushy
and
I
can
understand
that
,
but
I
find
the
staff
more
helpful
than
anything
else
.
Tiffany
is
fabulous
!
She
immediately
went
to
the
back
,
brought
out
leather
cleaner
and
cleaned
my
purse
on
the
spot
.
I
did
n't
even
buy
the
bag
there
!
Huge
selection
and
,
great
suggestions
from
the
staff
and
they
refer
you
to
reliable
places
if
they
do
n't
have
what
you
need
.
We
were
expecting
a
great
experience
,
when
we
recieved
a
friendly
greeting
by
the
hosts
.
The
atmosphere
was
nice
and
very
clean
.
The
menu
had
plenty
of
options
even
for
picky
eaters
.
The
service
was
ok
,
our
waitress
kept
forgetting
our
drinks
even
though
we
reminded
her
several
times
.
To
start
we
tried
the
guacamole
and
salsa
verde
,
it
was
completly
flavorless
.
We
should
have
left
then
.
Everything
was
bland
,
completely
void
of
any
spice
or
flavor
.
We
have
never
had
mexican
food
this
bad
,
it
was
just
simply
gross
.
Hopefully
they
spice
things
up
or
they
wo
nt
be
in
business
long
.
I
recommend
La
Hacienda
Might
try
again
Pros
:
*
Jill
,
the
owner
,
is
very
nice
and
really
cares
about
her
feedback
*
Pretty
nice
atmosphere
*
Great
Dessert
*
Not
your
typical
veggie
selection
,
I
like
!
Do
n't
know
where
else
you
can
find
Purple
Hull
Peas
and
some
of
the
other
sides
.
Cons
:
*
Server
was
n't
very
pleasant
*
Pretty
small
portion
on
the
blackened
catfish
*
Overcooked
food
*
Time
,
took
about
25
minutes
from
ordering
to
eating
.
Half
the
tables
and
bar
were
empty
by
this
point
.
There
must
be
a
reason
so
many
people
like
it
there
.
Their
Club
sandwich
looks
tasty
,
maybe
that
'll
change
my
mind
....
and
a
different
server
.
very
professional
/
very
helpful
the
people
at
Fidelity
Leasing
were
very
friendly
and
helpful
.
i
was
looking
for
a
car
but
did
not
really
know
what
i
wanted
and
they
were
very
helpful
and
took
the
time
to
first
figure
out
what
my
needs
were
and
showing
me
various
options
to
meet
those
needs
.
they
seemed
more
interested
in
helping
me
find
the
right
car
rather
then
just
make
a
sale
.
my
experience
with
them
was
great
-
low
stress
,
very
helpful
and
very
personal
.
after
finding
the
car
i
wanted
they
took
the
time
to
go
over
each
step
and
making
it
as
painless
as
possible
.
from
start
to
finish
they
were
top
notch
.
i
would
highly
recommend
calling
these
people
up
for
your
next
car
.
This
insurance
co.
Is
a
joke
!!!
They
have
absolutely
no
communication
skills
whatsoever
.
if
you
do
n't
mind
being
robbed
,
cheated
or
lied
to
then
this
is
the
company
for
you
.
They
will
make
every
attempt
to
misinform
and
misrepresent
themselves
.
They
make
up
excuses
in
hopes
to
confuse
their
policy
holders
with
misinformation
.
as
an
example
they
took
payment
for
5
out
of
6
monthly
plan
premiums
for
a
yearly
policy
and
cancelled
the
contract
for
the
remainder
of
the
policy
for
reasons
they
stated
was
not
receiving
information
on
other
licensed
drivers
in
the
household
?
I
personally
provided
the
request
on
four
separate
occasions
and
they
claim
there
is
a
glitch
in
their
systems
?
Fantastic
Service
!
I
have
been
here
a
few
times
for
oil
changes
and
just
got
my
tires
,
alignment
and
state
inspection
done
yesterday
.
It
also
came
with
free
balance
and
rotation
for
the
life
of
the
tires
!
What
made
it
perfect
was
that
they
offered
transportation
so
that
I
would
not
have
to
wait
there
or
take
time
off
of
work
to
go
back
and
forth
or
try
to
find
a
ride
.
Great
service
,
great
pricing
and
SUPER
CONVENIENT
!
I
also
did
not
feel
like
they
tried
to
sell
me
a
bunch
of
services
that
I
did
not
need
.
Love
my
home
at
Creekside
The
management
from
Julie
and
Janice
to
the
work
staff
,
esp.
Edwin
,
are
just
wonderful
.
They
have
been
extremely
helpful
whenever
I
have
asked
for
help
.
Although
the
apartments
are
facing
Stokes
Street
and
close
to
the
Bascom
Light
Rail
,
the
location
is
surprisingly
quiet
.
I
have
never
had
any
problems
with
loud
neighbors
or
concerns
about
safety
.
The
apartments
are
within
walking
distance
to
Trader
Joe
's
,
Whole
Foods
,
and
other
stores
.
The
well
-
equipped
,
clean
gym
is
a
plus
!
Great
place
to
live
if
you
work
in
and
around
downtown
San
Jose
!
I
interviewed
several
contractors
for
a
kitchen
remodel
.
Not
once
did
I
feel
listened
to
like
they
actually
cared
about
what
I
wanted
,
all
they
were
interested
in
was
me
signing
a
contract
right
then
and
there
.
Very
high
pressured
sales
and
with
the
reviews
of
many
others
bad
service
.
I
'm
glad
I
trusted
my
gut
and
did
n't
get
sucked
into
doing
business
with
them
.
Find
someone
you
trust
that
actually
hears
you
and
wants
to
do
the
job
right
.
Do
n't
waste
your
time
or
money
!
I
took
my
3
year
old
son
here
at
the
weekend
and
to
be
honest
,
apart
from
the
shark
walkway
,
I
thought
it
was
rubbish
and
overpriced
.
Even
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
my
3
year
old
wanted
to
run
most
of
the
way
round
,
it
took
us
just
over
one
hour
start
to
finish
.
If
you
have
been
to
the
London
Aquarium
I
would
not
even
bother
with
this
.
(
For
some
reason
it
will
not
let
me
rate
it
one
star
-
it
is
not

Cranmore
Dental
and
Implant
Clinic
:
I
could
not
recommend
Dr
David
Nelson
enough
.
I
had
a
severe
phobia
of
attending
the
dentist
until
I
met
and
was
treated
by
Dr
Nelson
.
My
previous
apprehension
has
been
dismissed
and
I
no
longer
have
a
sinking
feeling
when
my
next
appointment
is
due
!
In
addition
to
the
core
treatment
,
Dr
Nelson
has
impressed
me
further
with
his
concern
and
interest
in
the
well
-
being
of
his
patients
â€“
his
dental
work
underpinned
by
a
strong
duty
of
care
to
every
patient
.
He
is
always
prepared
to
go
the
extra
mile
to
ensure
that
any
patient
discomfort
is
dealt
with
immediately

Pam
Gillies
After
my
trees
were
cleaned
up
,
they
gave
me
a
jar
of
salsa
.
No
joke
!
I
hate
to
say
check
them
out
just
for
the
salsa
,
but
James
,
I
NEED
another
jar
badly
:)
All
kidding
aside
,
they
are
a
very
good
company
,
I
have
a
hard
time
giving
any
service
biz
a
5
star
review
but
they
came
close
.
Very
affordable
(
do
n't
call
it
cheap
)
and
their
trimmers
were
quick
and
courteous
when
I
got
home
from
work
.
And
the
salsa
,
be
sure
to
ask
for
a
jar
and
have
plenty
of
chips
around
,
you
will
need
them
.....
Dr.
Mann
killed
our
pet
Yea
,
Dr.
Mann
ai
n't
so
great
.
We
took
our
beloved
kitty
to
him
and
it
came
back
dead
.
We
live
in
the
sub-division
around
the
corner
and
after
it
happened
and
we
brought
it
up
at
some
neighborhood
gatherings
we
discovered
that
several
people
from
this
neighborhood
alone
had
pets
go
to
Dr.
Mann
for
surgical
procedures
and
came
back
dead
.
If
you
take
him
here
for
shots
,
no
big
deal
but
I
would
never
let
this
man
apply
anesthetic
to
my
pet
ever
again
.
Oh
,
they
also
charged
me
for
the
procedure
(
$
250
)
AND
had
the
audacity
to
charge
me
a
$
25
'
DISPOSAL
'
fee
.
They
actually
itemized
it
as
a
DISPOSAL
fee
.
AVOID
AT
ALL
COSTS
.
the
food
was
horrible
not
cooked
like
it
should
be
,
they
got
the
order
wrong
on
a
number
of
occasions
,
and
once
forgot
about
my
order
.
Gone
downhill
since
change
in
ownership
Sigh
.
I
used
to
LOVE
this
place
.
But
now
that
they
are
part
of
a
chain
,
service
has
slipped
.
I
am
waiting
longer
at
BNA
for
my
pickups
and
last
time
I
parked
with
them
,
they
lost
my
car
key
.
Lucky
I
had
a
spare
with
me
!
To
date
they
have
not
made
good
by
either
finding
the
key
or
paying
for
a
new
one
.
(
These
new
car
keys
are
EXPENSIVE
to
copy
,
you
ca
n't
just
go
to
WalMart
.
)
Go
to
the
website
for
coupons
and
join
the
club
-
you
can
get
free
parking
.
However
,
with
BNA
offering
one
day
of
free
parking
due
to
construction
of
the
new
rental
car
facility
,
it
may
be
cheaper
to
park
at
BNA
.
Wife
and
I
attempted
to
adopt
a
dog
and
was
nothing
but
frustrating
.
We
arrived
Sunday
at
about
230
and
found
a
do
we
really
liked
.
We
were
told
that
we
could
n't
today
because
they
were
closing
soon
.
I
called
the
next
morning
to
let
then
know
my
wife
would
be
driving
in
.
They
gave
me
the
run
around
and
missing
paperwork
only
to
call
back
to
tell
me
someone
else
wanted
her
and
I
would
need
to
come
in
and
put
down
a
deposit
.
They
refused
.
Terrible
communication
as
well
.
At
one
point
they
told
me
the
dog
had
been
fixed
,
the
next
day
it
had
n't
.
College
is
a
Joke
and
the
Salon
is
a
JOKE
!
Went
to
the
school
here
OVER
PRICED
!!!!!!
You
do
NOT
learn
the
things
you
were
promised
.
You
have
to
bring
in
your
own
models
and
they
have
to
pay
for
you
to
use
them
if
you
do
nt
then
you
can
graduate
!
Going
back
after
graduating
you
r
told
you
get
a
discount
on
services
nope
you
do
nt
.
Staff
is
under
educated
.
Going
there
you
learn
the
school
does
not
care
about
the
services
given
just
about
the
money
.
Over
priced
for
students
to
learn
!
Beware
of
the
nail
program
you
are
not
taught
to
use
a
nail
drill
AT
ALL
you
learn
the
old
fashioned
way
of
doing
nails
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
well
in
a
salon
!!!
BEWARE
!
You
can
fool
people
This
store
is
proof
that
you
can
fool
people
with
good
advertising
.
They
convince
lots
of
people
that
they
are
a
great
store
,
when
in
fact
they
are
a
very
average
place
at
best
,
they
are
just
another
big
box
store
like
the
others
.
They
offer
sales
that
are
n't
really
sales
,
mislabeled
items
that
make
the
item
sound
like
a
good
deal
when
it
is
n't
,
a
bad
attitude
about
return
items
,
and
on
and
on
.
With
higher
than
average
prices
to
boot
!
So
do
n't
get
taken
in
,
keep
your
eyes
open
if
you
choose
to
shop
here
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
Richmond
Ukrops
chain
is
known
for
its
charity
work
,
its
community
action
,
and
its
interest
in
the
public
welfare
.
Never
again
Do
n't
go
here
unless
you
want
to
sit
,
order
,
eat
and
be
asked
to
leave
all
in
a
matter
of
20
minutes
.
You
wo
n't
even
have
time
to
read
the
entire
menu
before
being
asked
to
order
and
if
you
ask
for
more
time
your
server
will
wait
at
the
table
.
This
is
the
only
place
I
have
ever
eaten
and
been
told
to
leave
because
other
people
were
waiting
.
I
was
told
to
take
my
coffee
to
go
if
I
wanted
to
finish
it
.
Oh
,
and
their
liquor
license
was
expired
so
no
Bloody
Mary
or
Mimosas
.
Plus
the
drinks
are
self
service
,
have
fun
trying
to
negotiate
the
small
cafeteria
space
to
get
your
coffee
,
juice
or
water
.
Go
next
door
to
the
Ball
Square
Cafe
instead
.
I
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
.
I
tried
to
stay
here
for
a
few
nights
with
my
girlfriend
,
so
we
asked
for
a
single
queen
bed
.
We
got
there
,
and
we
were
treated
to
the
free
"
upgrade
"
of
a
room
with
two
double
beds
.
Since
they
consider
this
an
upgrade
,
they
let
their
other
rooms
fill
up
and
would
not
change
our
room
.
Then
we
got
put
in
a
room
with
a
huge
gap
under
the
door
....
right
next
to
the
ice
machine
.
We
could
hear
every
single
thing
that
happened
outside
like
it
was
inside
our
room
.
When
I
finally
found
someone
at
the
desk
who
could
speak
English
,
they
moved
our
room
,
but
we
still
did
not
receive
the
single
queen
we
had
"
reserved
"
I
was
thoroughly
impressed
!
I
had
a
problem
with
the
tile
in
my
bathroom
coming
apart
.
I
called
a
few
different
businesses
in
the
area
to
get
estimates
,
they
were
n't
the
cheapest
I
found
but
very
reasonable
.
They
had
the
work
done
in
about
half
the
time
quoted
which
made
me
and
my
wife
extremely
happy
.
We
have
had
nothing
but
compliments
on
our
bathroom
when
guest
come
over
-
who
would
have
guessed
that
one
?
Very
nice
work
and
friendly
guys
too
.
I
highly
recommend
any
one
considering
home
repair
to
give
these
guys
a
call
.
New
training
Centre
is
excellent
The
Award
Dance
Centre
has
moved
from
its
Holderness
Road
site
to
a
new
complex
on
Chamberlain
Road
Hull
.
The
new
Centre
has
4
studios
planned
and
now
boasts
the
largest
single
dance
floor
area
in
Kingston
upon
Hull
.
The
classes
cover
all
age
and
skill
ranges
,
with
BALLROOM
,
LATIN
,
SEQUENCE
,
STREET
,
DISCO
,
LINE
DANCING
,
BALLET
,
TAP
&
JAZZ
.
We
have
attended
A
Ward
Dance
Centre
for
over
a
year
and
really
enjoy
the
friendly
and
welcoming
way
we
are
taught
Ballroom
and
Latin
as
well
as
the
fun
filled
social
dance
evening
held
every
Saturday
evening
....
It
is
not
really
possible
to
score
this
school
too
highly
,
We
would
give
it
12
out
of
10
and

Stars

Steve
&
Anne
I
purchased
a
2
-
year
old
certified
pre-owned
BMW
from
this
dealership
.
The
night
I
drove
back
home
,
I
found
that
the
rear
window
has
some
leakage
.
(
You
can
hear
the
wind
while
driving
on
highway
.
Very
likely
it
needs
a
new
window
seal
)
.
I
admit
that
I
should
have
paid
attention
to
this
kind
of
little
things
while
test
drive
.
(
But
this
is
a
certified
car
from
a
dealer
.
)
So
I
brought
the
car
back
the
second
day
.
They
told
me
that
this
is
not
under
warranty
and
want
to
charge
me
$
175
just
to
diagnose
the
problem
!
Who
knows
how
much
they
want
me
to
pay
to
fix
this
thing
.
I
walked
away
.
So
my
advice
is
that
NEVER
TRUST
THIS
DEALER
.
STAY
AWAY
AS
FAR
AS
POSSIBLE
.
Perfect
Practice
After
I
had
chosen
The
Fountain
Dental
Practice
they
provided
a
slick
and
professional
service
from
start
to
finish
.
Everyone
was
friendly
from
the
receptionist
to
the
surgeon
herself
,
putting
me
at
my
ease
and
explaining
the
whole
process
,
both
initially
and
then
as
we
went
along
.
Surgery
visit
timings
were
always
made
to
suit
me
and
not
them
and
they
gave
me
the
feeling
that
I
mattered
and
was
important
to
them
.
The
surgery
itself
is
slick
,
modern
and
very
relaxed
and
I
always
felt
that
I
was
in
capable
hands
.
My
dental
surgeon
,
Dr.
Lucy
Nichols
is
clearly
a
dental
perfectionist
and
clearly
proud
both
of
the
work
she
does
and
the
reputation
she
has
established
.
Everyone
was
so
helpful
that
I
can
not
wait
to
go
back
.....
Peter
Wonderful
service
for
large
group
It
was
a
great
deal
--
we
paid
a
certain
amount
per
person
,
and
my
husband
and
I
chose
4
types
of
pizza
and
the
servers
brought
out
as
much
as
we
wanted
.
We
were
also
served
salad
and
soda
.
We
had
a
large
party
,
about
fifty
people
or
so
,
and
yet
everything
was
served
quickly
and
we
all
had
a
wonderful
time
.
Even
though
we
were
only
supposed
to
have
those
specific
types
of
pizza
,
when
guests
asked
for
a
different
type
,
it
was
brought
out
with
no
charge
to
us
!
wonderful
I
went
to
ohm
after
reading
some
of
the
reviews
.
I
go
to
school
in
the
area
and
usually
wait
until
I
go
home
to
get
my
hair
cut
.
I
decided
it
was
time
to
grow
up
and
made
an
appointment
.
Sierra
was
my
stylist
and
i
love
what
she
did
.
I
have
wavy
hair
and
she
cut
to
my
hair
style
.
It
was
the
first
time
i
had
left
a
salon
with
my
hair
curly
.
Usually
they
blow
dry
it
out
and
i
have
to
wait
until
i
wash
it
to
see
what
it
will
look
like
in
its
natural
state
.
But
she
did
a
fabulous
job
letting
me
know
what
she
was
doing
at
all
times
and
styled
my
hair
in
a
way
i
could
do
it
at
home
.
It
was
n't
completly
impossible
!!!!
I
am
definitely
going
back
After
recently
relocating
to
South
Bend
,
we
were
looking
for
a
delicious
,
fun
,
yet
elegant
establishment
for
New
Year
s
Eve
dinner
.
We
were
disappointed
with
this
holiday
dinner
due
to
the
overall
flavor
and
price
of
the
meal
,
and
accessibility
to
the
Jazz
Club
.
The
meal
was
extremely
overpriced
and
lacked
flavor
,
especially
for
being
a
special
NYE
menu
.
The
limited
menu
had
few
appetizing
options
and
the
NYE
special
packages
were
way
overpriced
.
After
our
meal
,
our
server
found
us
a
table
in
the
jazz
club
where
we
were
informed
it
would
be
another
$
10
/
person
to
stay
and
listen
to
the
band
,
despite
the
fact
we
had
just
finished
a
dinner
there
and
were
intending
to
enjoy
their
drink
list
.
This
was
a
less
than
impressive
experience
at
Trio
's
.
One
night
was
too
much
.
First
room
had
used
tissues
next
to
the
bed
and
I
requested
it
be
rectified
.
I
was
then
moved
to
another
room
around
the
back
where
the
room
was
dirty
,
the
shower
was
dirty
with
other
people
s
hair
in
it
,
the
toilet
seat
was
peeling
and
rough
and
the
bathroom
was
full
of
mould
.
To
warn
you
to
stay
away
from
this
place
just
is
n't
enough
.
There
was
not
one
ounce
of
caring
involved
and
anyone
I
can
warn
about
the
complete
lack
of
service
will
be
warned
.
Grocery
and
Daily
Needs
Store
Before
using
FusionRetail
Before
installing
FusionRetail
store
was
running
on
a
dos
based
software
.
We
were
having
a
major
problem
in
maintaining
cash
.
Being
a
grocery
shop
,
maintaining
5000
different
products
was
a
challenging
job
.
Managing
POS
counter
without
barcoding
was
really
a
tough
time
.
How
FusionRetail
has
overcome
these
issues
?
FusionRetail
helps
us
to
maintain
the
store
in
an
organised
way
.
Usage
of
product
barcodes
and
smooth
maintenance
of
inventory
with
proper
recording
of
transactions
like
sale
,
purchase
and
returns
was
never
easy
before
.
How
long
does
it
take
to
train
new
people
at
work
?
Billing
takes
15
minutes
and
back
office
jobs
takes
1
day
's
training
How
fast
your
support
queries
get
answered

Over

On

,
it
takes
a

to
get
our
issues
resolved
.
Ca
n't
wait
to
go
back
!!!
We
were
in
Santa
Fe
for
a
special
event
and
our
hosts
rented
out
the
El
Paradero
for
all
their
guests
to
stay
at
.
We
could
not
have
been
more
welcomed
,
more
comfortable
or
more
well
fed
.
The
weekend
was
perfect
in
every
way
,
in
large
part
to
Sue
and
her
great
staff
.
Everyone
was
so
friendly
and
really
went
out
of
their
way
to
make
sure
everything
went
well
.
We
can
not
wait
to
go
back
to
Santa
Fe
and
to
this
great
B&B
...
especially
my
4
year
old
,
who
made
friends
with
Ms.
Sue
and
all
the
ladies
,
and
has
talked
about
them
since
we
left
!
We
would
highly
recommend
the
El
Paradero
on
your
next
trip
to
Santa
Fe
!
A&E
came
out
,
charged
$
129
fee
just
to
walk
in
the
door
.
I
needed
a
part
for
my
appliance
,
the
cost
was
very
high
so
I
said
never
mind
,
paid
the
fee
and
called
a
local
business
for
a
second
quote
.
The
second
vendor
charged
$
55
(
less
than
half
of
what
A&E
charges
)
to
come
and
applied
that
to
the
price
of
the
repair
service
(
which
A&E
does
not
)
.
Their
quote
came
in
at
half
the
price
of
A&E
for
the
same
work
and
same
part
.
Seems
to
me
like
A&E
charges
way
more
than
necessary
!
Very
disappointed
in
Kitchen
Aid
as
well
,
I
thought
that
they
pre-screened
their
vendors
for
price
and
quality
of
work
,
obviously
they
do
not
!
Lovely
Nails
on
Cayuga
St.
in
Lewiston
,
NY
First
let
me
start
out
by
saying
,
that
I
have
had
very
nice
pedicures
at
Lovely
Nails
on
Military
Road
.
I
was
very
excited
that
a
salon
was
opening
in
Lewiston
,
as
I
live
in
Youngstown
.
There
were
four
of
us
and
I
was
taken
first
by
a
gentleman
.
I
put
my
foot
in
the
water
and
it
was
cool
.
He
did
warm
it
up
.
He
also
hurt
my
toes
will
pushing
my
cuticles
back
.
The
other
ladies
had
a
similar
experience
,
both
had
nail
polish
on
a
couple
of
toes
.
None
of
us
will
be
using
their
services
again
,
which
is
a
shame
.
Good
Service
-
Limited
Results
Andrew
was
helpful
and
knowledgeable
about
acupuncture
re
:
infertility
.
He
was
willing
to
talk
to
me
about
my
specific
issues
and
develop
a
plan
of
action
.
The
office
is
shared
with
a
foot
doctor
and
it
's
very
sterile
and
medical
feeling
,
which
I
liked
.
The
down
side
was
that
sometimes
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
in
the
hallway
from
other
patients
/
doctors
.
I
worked
with
Andrew
for
2
months
and
did
acupuncture
and
herbs
.
The
sessions
were
nice
and
I
felt
relaxed
after
them
but
did
not
notice
any
changes
with
my
cycles
.
I
know
it
can
take
a
while
for
results
and
did
n't
expect
a
miracle
,
but
after
2
months
I
felt
like
it
was
not
entirely
worth
the
cost
/
time
.
(
I
am
also
a
little
suspicious
of
all
these
glowing
reviews
...
)
Friendly
,
clean
and
excellent
location
The
staff
was
very
helpful
,
and
gave
us
good
advice
on
day
and
night
time
activities
.
Common
room
was
comfortable
and
clean
,
very
good
room
to
read
or
relax
.
â€“
A
great
breakfast
which
was
included
every
morning
until
9:30
am
;
yummy
fresh
Parisian
croissants
.
Comfortable
and
clean
beds
,
a
bit
noisy
when
people
were
coming
in
late
from
a
night
out
,
but
we
did
n't
mind
too
much
as
we
were
also
just
coming
in
from
a
night
out
!
The
location
is
really
stellar
!
It
is
next
to
Gare
du
Nord
and
a
five
minute
walk
to
Sacre
Coeur
which
is
excellent
for
shopping
.
We
really
enjoyed
our
stay
and
would
definitely
stay
at
the
Vintage
Hostel
again
.
Was
fast
and
easy
,
Just
had
our
car
returned
this
morning
,
I
would
recommend
these
Mobile
Mechanics
for
sure
.
They
certainly
know
what
they
are
doing
.
The
mechanic
came
to
our
place
and
sorted
out
our
car
s
problems
,
he
explained
the
problem
and
was
very
up
front
and
honest
,
it
was
towed
to
the
workshop
as
the
gearbox
was
not
working
(
he
explained
it
better
)
.
They
phoned
the
same
day
,
confirmed
it
was
the
gearbox
quoted
me
the
job
,
I
gave
the
go
ahead
.
Now
my
car
s
gears
and
brakes
have
never
run
so
well
...
ever
it
s
like
driving
a
new
car
.
I
stopped
in
today
@
Yards
Brewery
.
I
must
say
,
I
was
impressed
with
the
size
of
the
bar
area
and
lounge
,
&
I
liked
that
you
could
see
the
brewery
right
thru
the
glass
!
I
had
a
sampler
of
IPA
,
Brawler
,
Love
Stout
&
ESA
.
All
were
awesome
,
&
I
had
a
Dogwood
Grilled
Cheese
which
was
enjoyable
with
the
fine
beers
.
If
you
are
in
Philly
you
have
to
come
check
this
place
out
!
The
only
negative
I
have
abou
this
place
is
the
parking
!
I
left
with
a
case
of
BRAWLER
!!!!

Oil
Change
Disaster
My
wife
had
taken
her
'07
Ford
Fusion
in
for
a
routine
oil
change
.
A
couple
days
after
the
oil
change
,
the
engine
ran
rough
,
the
low
oil
pressure
light
would
come
on
sporadically
,
and
the
engine
would
whir
loudly
.
Turns
out
the
engine
had
no
oil
,
and
when
oil
was
put
it
,
it
would
just
run
out
of
the
filter
.
There
could
have
(
hopefully
does
n't
have
)
major
damage
to
the
engine
.
All
of
this
started
after
their
oil
change
.
Once
they
realized
their
mistake
they
sent
a
mechanic
and
tow
truck
to
my
wife
's
work
and
towed
it
back
to
fix
it
.
I
would
not
recommend
this
shop
for
anything
,
not
even
something
as
simple
as
an
oil
change
.
Plus
they
will
overcharge
you
for
just
about
everything
,
and
smile
while
doing
it
.
Liars
,
negative
stars
!
Took
my
Cruze
in
twice
for
poor
fuel
economy
.
The
first
time
they
claimed
to
get
reasonable
mpg
.
However
,
they
would
never
drive
the
car
with
me
in
it
to
prove
their
findings
.
I
wonder
if
they
were
going
down
a
hill
!
They
told
me
to
bring
it
back
after
5000
miles
.
I
brought
it
back
with
9000
miles
.
They
"
finished
"
the
work
and
told
me
the
car
was
ready
.
I
found
out
they
did
not
even
drive
the
car
,
stated
they
looked
at
it
before
.
They
still
would
not
drive
the
car
with
me
to
show
their
mpg
number
.
I
will
never
purchace
another
vehicle
from
Vic
Canever
.
Great
Job
I
want
to
say
that
Mike
did
a
great
job
for
our
family
in
our
time
of
need
.
Both
my
grandparents
passed
away
4
months
apart
and
Mike
was
very
understanding
.
It
was
a
very
trying
time
for
my
family
and
myself
yet
Mike
took
the
time
to
greet
each
and
every
one
one
of
us
.
He
is
very
professional
in
his
position
as
a
director
and
yet
he
still
made
time
to
be
compassionate
for
what
we
were
all
going
through
.
I
'm
sure
it
s
not
every
day
that
a
funeral
director
sees
the
same
family
in
such
a
short
time
.
My
grandfather
passed
away
silently
in
his
sleep
,
and
my
grandmother
passed
away
after
a
short
struggle
with
cancer
.
Both
my
grandparents
looked
as
natural
as
could
be
expected
.
Thank
you
Mike
for
all
your
help
professionally
and
personally
.

Poor
service
If
you
like
the
drama
described
in
popular
sitcom
'
Seinfeld
'
,
you
will
see
it
here
.
We
signed
our
name
in
about
6:00
pm
.
There
were
3
names
before
us
.
The
greeter
said
there
was
about
15
minutes
waiting
.
However
,
we
waited
and
waited
and
in
the
mean
time
,
saw
4
groups
of
people
simply
just
paraded
in
without
signing
there
names
.
This
sign
in
policy
is
posted
by
the
restaurant
â€œ
no
reservation
,
sign
your
name
here
â€
.
I
had
to
ask
the
greeter
,
he
explained
his
reasons
with
broken
English
.
I
could
not
understand
any
his
reasons
.
I
could
only
take
it
as
they
would
seat
the
people
they
know
first
.
My
conclusion
is
that
you
should
only
go
there
if
you
want
to
wait
a
least
an
hour
and
see
all
kinds
other
people
being
seated
before
you
.
Instructor
never
showed
up
!
January
15th
--
We
were
signed
up
for
Saturday
's
2
PM
class
"
Beginning
Yoga
with
Brittany
.
"
We
even
arrived
10
minutes
early
as
the
website
suggests
.
The
instructor
did
not
show
up
!
We
waited
until
2:25
PM
and
then
left
.
There
were
2
in
our
group
,
and
a
3rd
person
was
also
in
the
parking
lot
waiting
for
this
class
.
Well
,
not
much
I
can
say
except
I
'm
very
disappointed
with
this
experience
.
This
was
our
first
visit
to
your
studio
.
In
today
's
instant
world
,
there
's
no
reason
for
the
instructor
not
to
even
have
given
us
a
phone
call
or
e-mail
if
she
was
going
to
be
late
.
As
a
yoga
studio
,
I
'm
sure
you
're
all
aware
that
all
actions
generate
karma
â€¦
and
sometimes
karma
can
manifest
itself
on
a
bad
review
on
Google
.
Finest
??
Really
??
I
beg
to
differ
.
This
place
is
marginal
at
best
.
Not
very
welcoming
and
focused
mostly
on
keeping
little
kids
entertained
.
I
was
not
impressed
,
and
quite
frustrated
at
their
lack
of
rating
for
their
courses
.
I
understand
not
wanting
to
put
labels
like
5.10
on
an
indoor
course
,
because
yes
,
it
is
not
the
same
,
but
some
clear
understanding
of
the
difficulty
of
one
course
to
another
is
nice
when
you
are
an
intermediate
climber
looking
to
improve
.
Rate
the
routes
,
with
understandable
markings
and
a
more
detailed
system
than
easy
,
moderate
,
and
hard
.
Again
,
a
great
outing
for
the
kids
,
a
frustration
for
an
out
of
town
climber
.
Wow
!
They
were
thorough
,
high
class
,
and
went
above
and
beyond
.
We
never
had
to
worry
about
a
thing
,
and
they
led
the
way
the
whole
time
.
They
asked
us
things
that
we
would
have
never
have
thought
of
,
and
took
extra
time
to
meet
with
us
when
we
needed
it
before
the
wedding
.
They
may
look
young
but
do
n't
let
that
fool
you
,
as
their
knowledge
of
music
far
surpassed
what
we
expected
.
So
we
did
n't
expect
them
to
even
know
some
of
the
requests
that
we
asked
that
night
.
They
just
really
know
their
stuff
!
NEVER
fear
going
to
the
dentist
again
!
I
'm
61
years
old
and
have
dental
problems
my
entire
life
.
By
the
age
of
24
I
stopped
going
to
the
dentist
.
My
fear
and
discomfort
from
dental
work
scared
me
!
It
took
all
the
courage
I
could
muster
to
make
an
appointment
.
At
the
front
door
of
his
office
,
I
nearly
turned
around
.
I
considered
just
leaving
after
going
inside
and
nearly
did
.
Doctor
Gonzales
and
his
entire
staff
are
the
most
professional
people
I
have
ever
dealt
with
.
They
made
me
feel
confident
in
what
they
would
do
,
and
treated
me
like
a
member
of
their
own
family
.
I
never
felt
pain
or
discomfort
.
The
ability
to
smile
and
eat
again
can
only
be
described
as
a
whole
new
lease
on
life
.
Thank
you
Doctor
Gonzales
,
Doctor
Stout
,
Eva
Marie
and
the
entire
staff
!

HORRIBLE
SERVICE
AND
FOOD
not
only
is
this
place
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
,
it
s
horrible
!
In
the
past
,
I
got
a
steak
and
there
was
more
fat
and
rough
pieces
than
there
was
good
steak
(
and
this
was
the
sirloin
!
)
,
the
sides
were
drenched
with
butter
and
the
salad
was
a
little
on
the
brown
side
.
Today
we
went
for
a
party
(
during
lunch
,
so
the
place
was
empty
)
with
about
25
other
people
.
Does
it
seriously
take
that
long
for
a
soup
and
salad
?
I
would
NOT
recommend
having
a
party
here
or
even
going
here
.
Spay
and
neuter
service
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
the
rescue
is
wonderful
.
But
I
had
my
cat
spayed
through
their
reduced
/
free
spay
and
neuter
program
and
the
vet
they
sent
us
to
was
first
of
all
a
hour
and
a
half
away
,
and
4
days
later
we
had
to
bring
them
to
our
normal
vet
because
the
vets
at
the
place
in
wisconsin
did
a
crappy
job
and
they
got
infections
.
My
vet
even
said
it
was
not
my
fault
it
was
the
vet
that
did
the
surgery
,
So
I
would
not
recommend
getting
that
program
unless
you
have
an
extra
hundred
dollars
or
so
for
antibiotics
and
a
vet
visit
.
You
'd
think
they
would
do
a
good
job
but
they
do
n't
care
unless
they
are
getting
paid
full
price
.
Which
is
so
dumb
.
Not
to
mention
the
fact
that
they
gave
us
our
cats
back
not
even
30
minutes
after
they
were
out
from
surgery
.
Billing
Issues
...
I
had
a
routine
surgery
for
an
ingrown
toenail
.
My
insurance
company
,
Blue
Cross
/
Blue
Shield
paid
the
fees
and
everything
was
fine
.
Then
I
got
a
bill
for
$
483.00
.
Blue
cross
has
no
record
of
aa
reversal
.
The
office
refused
my
requests
to
see
what
they
got
from
BC
/
BS
.
They
eventually
turned
it
over
to
a
collection
agency
and
now
will
not
even
discuss
the
matter
.
I
eventually
decided
to
just
pay
the
balance
even
though
the
doctor
has
already
been
paid
,
but
now
the
collection
agency
is
trying
to
say
another
reversal
of
$
160.00
has
come
through
.
It
was
an
ingrown
toenail
.
How
much
could
it
possibly
cost
?
Not
only
am
I
being
bilked
for
money
I
do
not
owe
,
the
office
staff
is
rude
to
boot
.
I
think
this
office
has
some
serious
billing
practice
issues
!
We
were
looking
for
a
company
with
decent
rates
as
our
company
was
just
getting
started
.
On
one
order
,
we
needed
it
rushed
and
shipped
to
a
different
state
.
They
did
that
with
no
problem
.
I
also
appreciate
their
honesty
.
I
sent
a
graphic
that
would
have
been
distorted
if
printed
as
it
was
.
They
called
and
worked
with
me
to
fix
it
so
that
it
would
look
perfect
.
They
recently
surprised
me
a
larger
order
.
I
ordered
1000
postcards
,
we
normally
order
5000
or
more
.
Because
they
had
room
to
do
5000
,
they
created
the
larger
amount
,
and
shipped
them
early
.
I
recommend
this
company
to
ANYONE
and
everyone
that
needs
great
work
done
at
a
reasonable
rate
!
They
have
a
customer
for
life
in
us
!
i
made
the
mistake
of
buying
from
these
thieves
.
I
paid
2
k
cash
for
a
truck
with
a
blown
motor
.
Their
so
called
mechanic
said
the
engine
was
good
and
"
There
is
nothing
mechanicly
wrong
with
this
truck
"
.
Anyway
they
jimmy
rigged
it
so
i
could
drive
it
home
.
The
next
day
i
took
it
to
2
auto
shops
and
they
both
told
me
the
same
thing
,
engine
is
junk
.
From
a
moral
standpoint
,
you
guys
are
really
gon
na
take
2,000
bucks
from
someone
that
needs
that
truck
to
work
and
support
his
family
when
you
know
it
s
just
a
piece
of
scrap
metal
?
If
it
lasted
1
month
i
could
suck
it
up
but
1
day
?
Grimy
work
you
guys
do
.

popped

It

to

would
probably
come
back
for
more

Watch
out
for
your
wallet
!
This
company
is
overpriced
for
their
services
.
They
pride
themselves
on
being
an
event
and
team
building
company
for
corporate
clients
but
you
better
believe
they
are
going
to
mark
you
up
on
that
feel
good
premise
.
I
've
spoken
to
vendors
who
are
used
by
them
who
had
nothing
good
to
say
about
the
company
as
well
and
in
fact
were
afraid
to
quote
events
against
them
even
though
they
openly
admitted
that
they
felt
Canadian
Outback
was
pricing
their
entertainment
out
of
the
market
and
doing
more
to
hurt
their
business
than
help
them
.
Be
warned
-
they
'll
ltake
you
for
everything
they
can
.
Believe
me
.
This

Orr
's
a
nightmare
!
DO
N'T
GO
!
My
boyfriend
and
I
were
woken
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
our
campsite
by
drunken
kids
who
'd
arrived
around
1:00
am
and
were
drinking
at
the
springs
.
When
we
complained
to
the
management
(
as
we
were
instructed
to
do
if
there
were
any
problems
)
,
nothing
happened
!
Then
,
the
next
morning
,
when
we
,
among
many
other
irate
guests
,
asked
to
speak
to
the
owner
,
he
refused
to
do
so
.
Not
only
that
,
but
he
told
us
,
via
his
manager
,
that
it
was
our
responsibility
to
get
up
a
second
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
call
the
night
staff
if
the
problem
continued
,
even
though
his
manager
did
nothing
the
first
time
to
stop
the
kids
.
Orr
is
not
relaxing
,
it
's
not
a
safe
space
,
and
the
owner
is
awful
.
To
add
insult
to
injury
,
he
refused
to
refund
our
money
.
Do
n't
go
!
I
enjoyed
my
time
at
Franklin
High
School
.
All
to
the
good
.
For
those
who
care
,
a
good
proportion
of
the
my
class
went
on
to
4
-
year
colleges
,
many
of
them
ranked
in
the
top
50
of
US
News
.
If
I
remember
,
students
went
to
Dartmouth
,
U.
Penn
,
Duke
,
BU
,
William
and
Mary
,
Vassar
,
Howard
,
and
Carnegie
Mellon
,
among
others
.
Many
students
went
to
Rutgers
,
including
their
top
-
ranked
pharmacy
program
.
The
point
is
--
FHS
gives
you
the
opportunity
to
make
it
to
a
good
college
,
but
you
need
to
work
hard
.
A
large
group
of
my
friends
and
I
rent
almost
the
whole
motel
every
year
for
a
weekend
,
and
the
experience
and
stay
have
always
been
five
-
star
.
The
rooms
are
SO
clean
,
the
managers
/
owners
are
the
nicest
people
,
the
place
feels
so
homey
,
and
the
location
and
grounds
are
beautiful
.
There
's
a
restaurant
nearby
(
walking
distance
)
with
a
great
breakfast
,
and
's
a
market
across
the
street
.
I
honestly
ca
n't
rave
enough
about
this
place
...
it
's
really
a
hidden
gem
worth
checking
out
!
My
favorite
cuban
cafe
in
Orlando
I
have
been
eating
Cuban
for
a
long
time
,
sandwiches
mainly
along
with
other
dishes
..
I
love
Cuban
coffee
,
colada
...
mmmm
anyways
I
found
this
place
and
ca
n't
stop
going
there
,
I
stop
in
at
least
once
a
week
and
anytime
I
'm
in
the
area
for
a
Cuban
coffee
or
snack
.
The
place
is
chill
and
comfortable
.
They
bake
bread
fresh
daily
,
they
do
n't
press
their
sandwiches
which
is
the
way
I
like
it
,
and
the
meat
is
always
fresh
.
They
have
a
great
lunch
special
with
your
choice
of
meat
,
chicken
,
steak
,
or
pork
and
rice
and
black
beans
and
fried
plantains
.
And
their
breakfast
is
awesome
!!
I
can
not
describe
how
delicious
the
mango
and
cheese
pastries
and
the
omelets
are
to
die
for
.
Stop
in
and
have
a
bite
you
wo
n't
regret
it
.
A
slice
of
heaven
in

park
off
forsyth
!
highly
recommended
.
I
have
been
going
to
Warner
Family
for
a
number
of
years
and
would
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
.
I
've
read
some
of
the
reviews
below
and
would
like
to
state
that
yes
,
like
any
other
doctor
s
office
there
is
sometimes
a
wait
(
depending
on
what
other
patients
are
being
seen
for
)
and
some
of
the
tests
and
procedures
that
are
ran
can
be
costly
(
just
like
they
would
be
for
any
other
medical
tests
elsewhere
if
you
do
not
have
insurance
)
...
I
have
seen
several
of
the
providers
from
the
office
and
have
not
once
been
shown
anything
but
care
and
consideration
.
I
personally
have
had
wonderful
service
and
if
you
re
truely
looking
for
a
FAMILY
practice
...
Warner
Family
is
the
place
for
you
.
Not
what
i
expected
!
We
read
the
good
reviews
before
going
and
had
high
hopes
..
but
to
our
dismay
it
did
nt
turn
out
that
way
!
Scallops
were
overcooked
and
the
foie
gras
was
cold
but
the
rest
of
the
food
was
lovely
.
On
top
of
that
though
they
tried
to
charge
us
service
charge
just
to
rub
it
it
....
Nice
selection
,
very
clean
,
friendly
staff
!
Hot
Iron
has
become
a
favorite
of
our
family
.
Everyone
can
get
the
signature
dish
with
ingredients
and
spices
that
they
want
and
have
the
fun
of
watching
it
cook
.
The
staff
are
very
friendly
and
conscientious
.
Every
time
we
go
they
seem
to
have
a
different
ingredient
or
two
which
keeps
things
interesting
.
Meats
are
kept
VERY
cold
,
seafood
smells
fresh
and
the
serving
bar
is
VERY
clean
.
Great
Cookies
,
Cakes
,
and
Customer
Service
It
was
my
birthday
and
I
had
a
last
minute
idea
to
have
a
bakery
cake
instead
of
one
pre-made
in
a
convenience
store
,
but
the
problem
was
it
was
the
day
before
Valentine
s
and
when
many
bakeries
turned
me
down
for
a
plain
vanilla
rectangle
cake
,
Fiona
stepped
up
to
the
plate
and
was
able
to
make
a
fantastic
beautiful
cake
.
Not
only
did
it
taste
wonderful
,
but
the
texture
was
unbelievable
,
the
frosting
was
n't
overly
sweet
to
over
power
the
cake
,
and
the
cake
itself
was
just
amazingly
soft
,
and
fluffy
,
and
just
perfect
overall
.
Although
I
'll
have
to
drive
a
little
out
of
my
way
to
go
there
,
I
'll
gladly
do
it
knowing
that
since
she
's
been
astounding
to
me
once
before
that
she
'll
always
be
that
way
!
(
Also
she
has
a
really
great
website
!
And
we
bought
a
few
cookies
there
too
,
they
were
fantastic
as
well
!
)
She
deserves
many
5
star
reviews
!!
Food
Craving
Gone
and
Weight
Loss
at
Acupuncture
Doctor
I
am
a
college
student
.
Before
treatment
,
my
food
cravings
were
"
out
of
control
"
which
caused
me
to
be
stressed
out
.
I
experienced
a
Definite
Decrease
in
food
craving
(
about
50
%
)
and
decrease
in
stress
after
the
1st
treatment
.
I
actually
loss
4
pounds
after
my
1st
treatment
and
loss
2
pounds
after
my
2nd
treatment
.
I
was
amazed
.
Before
coming
to
Acupuncture
DOCTOR
I
was
a
big
baby
about
needles
and
only
came
because
my
boyfriend
's
aunt
recommended
it
.
It
hurt
very
little
,
felt
more
like
pressure
than
pain
.
What
I
like
most
about
Dr.
Liau
is
that
she
is
very
caring
.
She
talks
to
you
at
each
appointment
.
I
can
tell
she
really
cares
and
wants
to
help
.
I
am
SO
GLAD
to
have
found
Dr.
Liau
.
Now
I
feel
more
confident
wearing
my
bathing
suit
in
the
summer
.
An
Asset
to
Richmond
For
a
long
time
,
one
big
source
of
entertainment
missing
from
the
Richmond
City
Limits
was
a
first
-
run
multiplex
.
Bowtie
has
filled
that
role
nicely
.
The
owners
of
Bowtie
manged
to
add
something
new
while
preserving
what
was
already
there
.
The
theatre
has
greatly
improved
the
surrounding
neighborhood
.
There
's
plenty
of
parking
,
and
I
've
never
had
an
issue
with
audience
members
who
wo
n't
stop
talking
or
answering
their
cellphones
.
Best
of
all
,
there
are
no
ads
!!!!
!
Just
previews
and
the
main
feature
.
But
if
you
like
going
to
the
movies
,
you
should
love
Bowtie
.
A
great
cinema
in
a
great
location
.
Thank
you
,
Bowtie

Craft
Wonderland
with
History
My
first
visit
was
so
fun
yesterday
.
I
could
have
stayed
all
day
and
not
seen
all
the
things
.
I
am
doing
origami
jewelry
and
found
exactly
the
right
things
for
earrings
and
got
many
other
ideas
there
too
.
I
bought
a
beginner
s
quilling
set
and
like
making
the
filigree
forms
you
can
make
and
add
to
other
crafts
.
The
owner
,
Jean
,
has
been
there
31
years
!
What
a
history
.
She
is
a
super
sweet
,
lovable
and
well
-
informed
woman
with
a
great
sense
of
humor
.
I
really
enjoyed
meeting
her
and
happy
to
learn
she
comes
from
Oklahoma
and
has
the
values
of
a
solid
no
bs
country
girl
.
This
store
is
a
real
gem
and
has
much
to
offer
the
serious
crafter
or
the
occasional
crafter
.
By
the
way
,
Salmagundi
(
the
store
name
)
means
something
like
smorgasbord
;
potpourri
;
motley
;
variety
;
mixed
bag
;
miscellaneous
assortment
;
mixture
,
a
variety
of
many
kinds
of
things
.
Great
name
for
a
great
store

I
am
a
proud
owner
of
a
brand
new
2010
Hyundai
Genesis
.
I
have
never
seen
this
car
before
until
this
lady
at
wal
mart
had
it
and
she
told
me
she
got
it
here
and
that
everyone
was
so
nice
to
her
.
I
asked
her
who
she
worked
with
and
she
just
told
me
ti
was
the
sales
manager
.
I
took
the
weekend
off
and
came
in
and
asked
for
the
manager
who
is
Jeff
and
he
remembered
her
right
away
even
remembered
her
dog
,
I
was
a
bit
shocked
that
someone
would
pay
that
close
attention
.
We
got
to
talking
and
he
got
me
set
up
and
I
test
drove
with
Craig
and
I
fell
head
over
heels
for
this
car
all
I
kept
saying
,
"
was
I
got
ta
have
it
!
"
Jeff
and
Craig
are
really
good
at
what
they
do
and
know
exactly
how
to
treat
a
customer
.
Definitely
go
see
them
!
Bait

untrained

Called
the
Bonanza
store
2
weeks
ago
,
before
I
ripped
out
350
sq
ft
of
ceramic
tile
...
was
told
I
would
need
a
"
dual
head
concrete
grinder
"
to
remove
thinset
and
make
a
nice
"
finished
"
look
(
ready
for
concrete
stain
)
.
Was
quoted
$
55
all
inclusive
of
grinder
inserts
,
etc
.
No
problem
,
sounded
like
it
's
done
every
day
.
Will
look
beautiful
.
Got
the
tile
ripped
out
,
call
today
,
now
all
the
sudden
this
grinder
wo
n't
leave
a
finished
look
AND
it
's
$
125
PLUS
around
$
75
for
the
inserts
.
I
can
rent
another
machine
for
like
$
60
that
will
give
it
a
finished
look
.
So
from
$
55
to
$
260
?
Are
they
serious
?
I
feel
like
they
did
n't
tell
me
the
pitfalls
before
I
pulled
out
this
tile
and
now
that
I
have
no
other
options
they
want
5
TIMES
the
price
?
One
suspects
that
earlier
reviewer
works
for
another
laundry
.
Outside
of
parking
being
at
a
premium
,
especially
on
discount
days
,
The
Laundry
Tub
is
not
filthy
and
it
's
no
smaller
than
any
of
a
dozen
laundromats
I
've
been
in
.
I
availed
myself
of
the
wash
'n
fold
service
,
taking
just
about
a
year
's
worth
of
dirty
clothes
in
and
getting
back
neatly
folded
,
clean
clothes
in
clear
plastic
bags
(
I
'd
originally
brought
them
in
,
in
six
large
yellow
garbage
bags
)
.
The
cost
was
certainly
reasonable
and
I
will
continue
my
patronage
of
The
Laundry
Tub
in
the
future
.
Did
n't
hurt
any
that
they
knew
my
name
by
my
second
visit
and
greeted
me
warmly
then
and
on
my
third
visit
.
Whereas
my
answer
to
the
question
"
Where
do
you
get
your
laundry
done
?
"
used
to
be
,
"
At
the
checkout
line
at
WalMart
,
"
I
can
honestly
say
the
answer
now
is
,
"
At
The
Laundry
Tub
.
"
Thank
you
!
I
recently
took
a
rescue
puppy
to
this
Clinic
and
I
was
SHOCKED
at
how
well
Romeo
and
My
family
was
treated
.
They
worked
around
the
clock
to
ensure
that
my
puppy
life
was
saved
.
We
have
to
leave
him
at
the
vet
for
3
days
and
I
was
told
to
call
for
check
ups
as
often
as
I
wished
that
no
matter
how
many
times
I
called
I
would
not
annoy
them
.
lol
They
where
super
friendly
towards
us
and
treated
us
like
people
not
walking
bags
of
cash
.
In
this
day
it
s
rare
to
find
such
wonderful
people
who
CARE
,
Not
the
kind
of
want
to
make
cash
.
I
would
strongly
suggest
you
give
them
the
chance
to
prove
to
you
that
not
all
people
in
this
world
are
evil
!
I
will
never
go
to
another
vet
as
long
as
I
have
animals
.
In
fact
I
look
forward
to
taking
my
animals
to
the
vet
simply
because
of
how
my
animals
and
I
are
treated
.
Okay
,
here
's
the
scoop
.
I
'm
a
regular
at
the
HH
.
I
think
they
're
still
in
the
mindset
from
when
it
was
only
smokers
sitting
around
and
drinking
...
not
in
any
hurry
.
In
my
experience
the
food
has
been
excellent
(
for
the
most
part
)
.
In
some
cases
the
result
is
because
of
understaffing
,
in
some
cases
the
staff
just
does
n't
care
/
know
better
.
They
must
also
get
something
to
keep
take
-
out
warm
,
so
it
's
not
room
temperature
at
best
when
you
get
it
home
.
You
just
have
to
know
what
you
're
getting
into
when
you
go
.
Nice
local
pub
,
excellent
food
(
especially
wings
)
,
and
do
n't
go
if
you
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
.
Trust
The
Midas
Touch
I
personally
trust
this
Midas
store
with
all
my
vehicles
,
I
have
been
going
there
for
years
&
would
never
go
anywhere
else
!
the
staff
is
very
personable
&
actually
care
about
the
customers
safety
rather
than
taking
there
money
.
This
is
however
a
very
busy
shop
but
there
are
appointments
available
&
the
staff
up
front
will
surely
make
sure
you
get
back
in
a
timely
manner
.
I
look
at
some
of
these
other
comments
&
laugh
because
people
think
that
the
world
revolves
around
them
!
Like
the
girl
with
the
fuse
problem
...
Midas
has
the
most
high
tech
equipment
in
town
&
I
guarantee
you
if
they
told
you
it
was
electrical
then
in
deed
it
s
electrical
!
maybe
you
should
understand
how
the
world
works
&
realize
you
are
just
like
any
other
person
&
not
put
yourself
on
a
pedestal
.
I
will
continue
going
to
Dave
at
Midas
because
he
is
one
of
the
most
honest
business
owners
in
this
town
!
When
having
your
car
worked
on
you
have
to
trust
the
mechanic
&
this
Midas
is
truly
someone
you
can
trust
!
We
decided
to
try
this
place
last
night
because
we
noticed
that
it
had
some
interesting
things
on
the
menu
aside
from
the
usual
rolls
--
live
scallop
sashimi
,
duck
breast
nigiri
with
foie
gras
,
panko
mussels
--
but
none
of
these
were
particularly
great
or
worth
the
sticker
price
.
Additionally
we
tried
the
Logan
Circle
roll
,
spicy
crab
and
tuna
roll
,
and
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
(
$
15
,
$
10
,
and
$
3.75
respectively
)
.
The
sweet
potato
tempura
roll
was
actually
a
great
surprise
:
cheap
and
delicious
,
the
only
thing
we
tried
that
I
would
say
was
well
worth
it
and
a
great
value
(
and
I
never
get
vegetarian
rolls
)
.
The
other
rolls
were
n't
at
all
special
,
especially
given
their
pricing
.
The
bottom
line
is
that
the
food
is
n't
great
and
is
relatively
high
-
priced
.
The
service
is
solicitous
,
the
atmosphere
is
nice
and
mod
except
the
out
-
of
-
place
flat
-
screen
TV
playing
football
.
But
I
'd
go
elsewhere
unless
the
prices
are
cut
.
It
's
just
not
worth
it
.
Do
n't
Expect
Sleep
or
Courtesy
I
was
booked
for
2
nights
at
this
hotel
in
Oct
2007
.
At
3:15
am
on
night
#
2
,
the
fire
alarm
and
strobe
light
activated
in
my
room
.
These
are
not
household
type
alarms
.
When
they
sound
off
,
it
is
a
true
audio
/
visual
experience
.
I
called
the
front
desk
and
got
no
answer
.
After
checking
for
signs
of
fire
or
smoke
and
seeing
none
,
I
decided
to
just
pack
up
and
leave
.
The
desk
agent
actually
argued
with
me
,
claiming
that
no
such
alarm
had
gone
off
(
as
if
I
would
make
that
up
?
)
.
He
finally
admitted
that
only
the
4
ADA
room
alarms
had
sounded
,
so
only
4
guests
were
effected
(
no
big
deal
to
him
)
.
This
little
drip
offered
no
apologies
whatsoever
,
and
even
refused
to
give
me
the
name
of
the
manager
until
I
pressed
him
for
it
3
times
.
This
hotel
is
adequate
enough
,
but
there
is
an
obvious
problem
with
the
staff
and
management
.
Do
not
go
there
if
you
expect
to
sleep
through
the
night
.
Poor
Service
,
Lack
of
Passion
:
Do
NOT
go
I
began
seeing
Dr.
Romanick
back
in
2000
and
have
seen
a
significant
decline
in
the
quality
of
care
,
patient
-
doctor
communication
,
and
just
the
overall
level
of
services
.
The
poor
quality
starts
at
the
receptionist
desk
,
where
the
staff
is
very
impatient
and
lack
the
efficiency
I
once
loved
about
the
office
.
It
took
them
nearly
two
months
to
complete
a
simple
task
,
and
countless
calls
from
my
part
due
to
their
lack
of
response
and
passion
(
not
that
it
's
a
requirement
for
the
job
,
but
it
helps
to
at
least
pretend
to
be
helpful
)
.
Also
,
I
was
promised
to
have
my
test
results
emailed
to
me
,
but
it
never
happened
,
and
after
a
few
attempts
to
get
Dr.
Romanick
on
the
phone
to
brief
me
on
my
condition
,
I
finally
gave
up
and
went
to
a
different
doctor
.
Please
do
not
go
there
if
it
's
professional
,
friendly
,
diligent
medical
services
you
're
looking
for
.
Save
yourself
the
trouble
,
money
and
time
and
visit
a
more
caring
facility
/
doctor
.
The
moving
company
is
actualy
based
in
Brooklyn
,
but
advertised
all
over
NY
/
NJ
,
including
Fort
Lee
.
That
was
not
in
agreement
eather
,
but
they
realy
demand
it
.
And
another
$
100
for
wrapping
the
furniture
.
So
totalling
$
212
just
for
start
before
any
work
started
.
Guess
what
,
was
not
in
the
initial
agreement
as
well
.
The
only
reason
I
'm
giving
3
stars
instead
of
1
or
2
,
I
should
admit
,
nothing
was
broken
.
So
I
still
can
recomend
them
but
prepare
pay
twice
as
much
as
they
tell
you
initially
.
One
more
thing
,
they
do
n't
take
any
credit
cards
or
checks
.
You
have
to
pay
CASH
ONLY
before
they
start
unloading
track
on
your
destination
.
We
lived
here
for
2
years
,
the
first
year
or
so
was
okay
.
We
were
always
having
our
water
shut
off
,
there
were
always
people
having
parties
at
the
pool
,
even
after
it
was
supposed
to
be
closed
.
The
pool
was
supposed
to
close
at
10
and
they
would
have
people
down
there
until
11:45
yelling
,
playing
music
and
do
who
-
knows
-
what
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
pool
.
Then
,
when
we
moved
out
,
we
cleaned
the
apartment
top
to
bottom
,
they
came
back
and
tried
to
charge
us
for
two
cleaning
fees
(
and
we
never
got
our
deposit
back
)
and
past
utilities
(
that
were
already
paid
,
we
have
check
numbers
and
records
of
this
)
.
Linda
is
the
rudest
person
you
will
ever
talk
to
and
she
sticks
up
for
all
of
the
trashy
,
rude
people
that
live
there
,
not
the
nice
ones
that
actually
give
a
crap
about
respecting
others
.
Do
not
live
here
,
you
will
regret
it
!
I
have
worked
with
Ted
Jurek
at
Decor
and
You
,
and
it
started
out
as
a
decent
experience
.
I
figure
I
would
give
this
company
a
chance
.
However
,
after
giving
a
required
$
500.00
(
NON
REFUNDABLE
)
deposit
before
seeing
any
plans
or
ideas
,
I
was
sorry
I
did
.
We
met
a
couple
of
weeks
later
,
Ted
was
late
.
He
brought
fabric
books
,
and
pictures
of
furniture
only
,
which
all
came
way
over
budget
.
By
the
time
we
got
to
the
budget
i
told
him
I
could
work
with
,
there
was
basically
no
design
.
Just
curtains
and
a
couple
of
accessories
.
WHAT
IS
THAT
?????
This
company
is
way
too
expensive
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
.
Please
everyone
....
take
heed
and
do
n't
get
caught
up
in
the
hype
about
DECOR
and
YOU
working
with
every
budget
...
This
is
just
a
way
for
them
to
squirm
their
way
into
your
precious
pocket
Horrible
.
Horrible
.
When
we
walked
in
,
the
person
behind
desk
said
:
"
oh
well
,
you
must
wait
,
I
am
in
the
middle
of
something
.
"
After
a
good
few
minutes
,
he
asked
:
"
what
do
you
want
?
"
Somewhere
in
between
his
rudeness
he
asked
if
we
smoked
.
I
asked
if
this
hotel
had
smoking
rooms
.
He
immediately
said
"
no
,
there
is
a
$
50
deposit
now
!
"
Sure
enough
he
charged
it
to
the
credit
card
.
When
I
inquired
he
rudely
replied
"
in
the
morning
when
things
are
checked
out
you
'll
get
it
back
.
"
I
called
customer
service
about
it
because
the
website
specifically
states
that
there
are
no
other
charges
at
the
check
-
in
.
I
also
mentioned
to
the
reception
person
.
He
responded
"
we
have
problem
with
'
people
'
"
.
Imagine
a
hotel
having
problems
with
people
.
I
finally
alerted
him
to
his
rudeness
.
He
said
he
's
had
a
long
and
bad
day
.
We
had
no
choice
but
to
stay
but
will
take
this
as
far
as
we
can
.
Do
n't
stay
there
.
I
came
to
find
out
the
person
was
the
hotel
OWNER
also
.
We
live
within
20
miles
of
the
hotel
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
our
responsibilities
for
the
night
.
Unfortunalty
my
husband
and
I
had
to
put
our
13
year
old
lab
down
that
morning
and
we
were
not
expecting
this
.
My
friend
called
the
hotel
to
cancel
our
room
as
soon
as
I
called
her
.
Times
are
hard
,
I
know
,
but
they
had
no
compassion
.
I
called
3
times
to
talked
to
a
manager
,
never
a
call
back
.
I
emailed
4
times
,
never
a
response
.
In
one
of
the
emails
I
attached
the
letter
from
the
Vet
's
that
expressed
their
sympathy
,
this
hotel
did
nothing
.
I
even
emailed
Mackinaw
Tourist
and
nothing
.
I
am
sure
this
is
a
good
place
to
stay
from
reading
the
other
reviews
,
but
if
something
unexpected
happens
in
your
life
,
they
will
not
care
.
Ok
I
am
a
New
Yorker
who
has
been
going
to
school
in
Oxford
,
England
.
I
thought
the
UK
was
completely
devoid
of
good
NYC
style
pizza
.
I
thought
to
get
a
decent
pizza
the
only
way
was
at
a
fancy
restaurant
,
and
I
have
to
get
a
whole
pie
.
I
thought
I
would
have
to
wait
until
I
went
home
to
NYC
.
Well
then
I
went
on
a
trip
to
Glasgow
and
was
walking
around
.
I
saw
this
place
and
it
looked
like
the
HOLY
GRAIL
.
They
have
crushed
red
pepper
flakes
and
oregano
.
So
I
ordered
a
slice
.
It
tasted
like
I
just
flew
back
home
.
I
du
n
no
how
they
did
it
,
but
Scottish
friends
---
this
is
THE
REAL
DEAL
.
That
being
said
,
I
do
n't
know
how
their
delivery
service
is
.
They
might
want
to
change
the
name
to
reflect
the
new
yorkedness
of
the
pizza
,
scrummy
yummy
sounds
gimmicky
to
me
.
Good
food
,
good
wait
staff
,
poor
management
We
visited
on
7/26/08
for
dinner
We
received
a
gift
certificate
for
the
Mama
Mia
's
on
Greenfield
Ave
.
The
food
was
good
,
and
so
was
our
waitress
.
When
it
came
time
to
pay
the
bill
up
front
,
they
would
not
let
me
use
any
of
the
certificate
for
a
tip
(
which
I
have
done
with
any
other
restaurant
I
've
gotten
a
gift
certificate
for
.
)
I
then
asked
if
I
could
have
money
back
in
cash
.
The
person
went
to
go
check
with
the
manager
,
who
was
sitting
at
a
table
chatting
with
her
friends
who
were
eating
there
.
Her
answer
was
short
and
manner
rather
rude
.
Sorry
for
interrupting
I
guess
.
The
cashier
was
also
short
,
unapologetic
and
made
me
feel
as
I
was
wasting
her
time
.
There
were
no
other
options
available
(
I
only
brought
my
check
card
to
cover
any
overage
cost
)
and
she
rang
it
up
and
applied
it
to
the
gift
card
before
telling
me
about
the
tip
policy
.
I
will
not
be
visiting
Mama
Mia
's
again
.
DINING
AT
TEXAS
ROADHOUSE
TEXAS
ROADHOUSE
HAS
VERY
GOOD
MEALS
,
THAT
THE
MEAT
COMES
RIGHT
OFF
THE
BONES
.
IT
HAS
VERY
GOOD
PRICES
.
ON
A
BAD
NOTE
THE
WAITING
AREA
IS
NOT
ENJOYABLE
OR
ENOUGH
SEATS
.
ALSO
,
THERE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
PEANUTS
ALL
OVER
THE
FLOOR
.
NEXT
,
THERE
SHOULD
ONLY
BE
ONE
PERSON
BRINGING
YOU
YOUR
FOOD
.
IT
S
NOT
A
BIG
DEAL
BUT
I
HAD
TO
TAKE
MY
SALAD
HOME
BECAUSE
THEY
FORGOT
TO
BRING
IT
.
I
HAD
TO
ASK
THE
GIRL
WHO
BROUGHT
MY
FOOD
AND
SHE
NEVER
CAME
BACK
TO
LET
ME
KNOW
.
I
HAD
TO
WAIT
FOR
MY
WAITRESS
.
WHEN
YOU
FIRST
COME
IN
THE
HOSTESS
IS
NOT
VERY
FRIENDLY
,
THERE
IS
JUST
A
BUNCH
OF
WORKERS
STANDING
THERE
.
I
WAS
THERE
ON
MARCH
6TH
,
2009
.
I
WAS
ALSO
THERE
OF
JULY
4TH
2008
,
WHEN
MY
DAUGHTER
S
BUFFALO
WINGS
CAME
OUT
WITH
A
FLY
ON
IT
.
THE
MANAGER
CAME
OVER
AND
SAID
HE
WAS
SORRY
AND
GAVE
A
NEW
BATCH
OF
WINGS
,
HE
SAID
WE
CA
NT
REALLY
DO
ANYTHING
BECAUSE
THE
DOORS
ARE
ALWAYS
OPENING
AND
CLOSING
.
IN
MY
OPINION
SHOULD
OF
JUST
TOOK
OFF
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
WINGS
FROM
THE
BILL
.
BUT
EVERYONE
HAS
THERE
OWN
WAY
!!!!!!
Mezza
Luna
FTW
!
it
s
like
a
pizza
roll
,
but
they
just
toss
ham
and
cheese
inside
.
it
seems
like
it
s
healthier
too
,
but
it
s
prolly
not
.
also
,
you
can
call
em
ahead
of
time
,
and
then
go
to
pick
up
ur
food
,
or
have
it
delivered
**
.
that
cuts
down
on
teh
wait
time
,
cus
u
can
do
other
stuff
while
u
r
waiting
.
their
pizza
was
a
little
salty
for
me
,
but
it
s
still
good
.
they
do
that
whole
thing
where
you
sandwich
the
pepperoni
between
layers
of
cheese
for
+
32
delicious
.
anyways
,
the
mezza
luna
:
you
should
try
it
.
it
runs
you
about
4
bucks
and
it
deals
crushing
blows
to
hunger
.
**
Edit
:
Living
on
campus
at
Clarkson
University
,
I
have
had
food
delivered
before
.
This
was
back
between
'05
and
'09
and
I
do
n't
remember
how
many
times
we
've
had
it
delivered
.
Perhaps
they
do
n't
deliver
anymore
,
but
the
deliciousness
of
a
mezza
luna
certainly
warrants
a
pickup
.
My
2004
x
-
type
was
getting
close
to
100,000
miles
so
it
was
time
for
an
upgrade
.
I
sent
my
wife
and
daughter
over
to
check
out
a
pre-owned
2009
XF
.
Michael
Chestney
was
very
pleasant
and
patient
with
my
wife
and
she
suggested
I
go
check
it
out
.
I
went
in
later
that
afternoon
and
met
with
Michael
.
He
showed
me
the
car
I
was
interested
in
and
we
took
a
test
drive
.
I
loved
the
car
so
we
began
negotiating
my
trade
-
in
and
the
price
of
the
09
XF
.
The
entire
negotiation
took
about
20
minutes
.
Fair
give
and
take
on
both
sides
until
we
agreed
on
a
deal
that
was
within
my
parameters
and
was
fair
to
both
sides
.
10
minutes
of
paperwork
and
I
was
the
owner
of
a
beautiful
pre-owned
09
XF
.
Friendly
,
knowledgeable
,
and
above
all
fair
.
That
's
all
you
can
really
ask
from
a
car
dealer
and
Michael
and
Barrett
hit
all
3
.
Thanks
for
the
great
deal
and
the
great
car
!
Identity
Theft
Myself
and
my
fiance
's
identity
was
stolen
from
the
office
staff
.
We
were
told
by
a
detective
and
asked
to
check
our
credit
for
anything
unusual
.
Luckily
they
caught
the
crooks
before
they
did
one
on
us
.
It
was
a
black
female
that
use
to
work
in
the
office
.
She
stole
the
information
and
gave
it
to
another
guy
that
did
all
the
work
.
The
other
guy
was
pulled
over
one
day
and
a
cop
saw
suspicious
papers
with
names
and
social
security
numbers
on
it
.
That
s
how
they
were
caught
.
They
both
went
to
jail
and
a
new
manager
was
put
in
charge
of
the
apartments
.
The
apartment
across
from
mine
belonged
to
a
gang
of
hookers
.
Nobody
lived
there
.
A
girl
would
show
up
,
then
a
guy
in
a
nice
car
would
show
up
.
Short
time
later
the
guy
would
leave
,
then
the
girl
leave
.
My
apartment
was
usually
quiet
.
I
lived
in
one
that
did
not
face
the
parking
lot
.
Parking
spaces
are
just
big
enough
for
a
Mini
Cooper
.
It
sucked
having
an
SUV
.
If
I
found
a
spot
,
I
could
nt
fit
in
it
.
Gates
worked
30
%
of
the
time
at
best
.
Bugs
were
a
small
problem
,
nothing
too
bad
.
It
was
4:50
when
a
friend
told
me
to
call
Bud
,
he
would
take
care
of
me
.
Not
only
did
they
answer
the
phone
at
4:50
on
a
Thursday
,
they
hit
the
ground
moving
!.
They
were
back
quickly
considering
how
far
outside
of
Murfreesboro
we
were
and
had
us
on
our
way
by
6:30
that
evening
.
Thanks
Bud
for
all
of
your
help
and
taking
time
away
from
your
family
that
evening
.
I
hope
I
can
return
the
favor
in
the
future
!
Alan
Grissom
Room
ok
.
Service
and
Client
base
not
ok
.
I
was
told
management
would
call
me
back
but
still
waiting
for
that
call
.
Was
there
this
past
weekend
and
the
guy
behind
the
counter
yelled
at
me
and
my
son
because
we
believed
he
left
the
grandma
slice
in
the
oven
a
little
too
long
and
the
cheese
got
all
dried
out
and
the
slice
tasted
more
like
a
cracker
.
He
preceded
to
grab
the
slice
off
the
countertop
and
throw
it
into
the
trash
while
yelling
at
me
saying
,
"
you
do
not
order
what
you
do
not
know
about
"
and
"
you
do
n't
know
how
pizza
is
made
"
.
It
was
very
upsetting
to
see
this
kind
of
behavior
especially
in
front
of
my
four
year
old
.
Cheese
was
falling
off
,
so
oily
and
greasy
.
I
think
he
did
it
on
purpose
because
of
my
simple
request
for
another
slice
of
grandma
that
was
n't
so
well
-
done
(
actually
,
burnt
)
.
THIS
STORY
IS
100
%
TRUE
.
Long
Lines
,
Silly
Rules
,
Rude
Staff
,
Ok
Food
The
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
arrive
on
location
is
that
the
waiting
line
literally
goes
out
the
door
and
spills
into
the
parking
lot
.
A
restaurant
with
this
many
patrons
willing
to
stand
in
line
just
to
order
tacos
must
be
good
,
right
?
Well
,
this
may
be
an
exception
.
And
do
n't
even
think
about
asking
to
speak
to
the
manager
because
this
guy
is
,
and
pardon
my
French
,
a
jerk
.
If
you
have
gotten
through
ordering
,
dealing
with
the
rude
staff
and
if
you
followed
the
dumb
rules
,
you
are
finally
presented
with
what
you
came
for
..
some
tacos
that
are
"
ok
,
"
but
definitely
not
worth
putting
up
with
all
the
hassle
.
Save
yourself
the
trouble
and
skip
this
place
all
together
.
I
suggest
you
go
up
to
Raging
Taco
&
Raging
Burrito
a
couple
of
blocks
up
the
street
or
even
Taco
Mac
.
Wish
this
was
in
Saratoga

We
were
introduced
to
Bistro
Tallulah
by
traveler

professional
diner
who
happens
to
own
the
Adelphi
Hotel
and
travels
the

--
and

New

the
rest
of
the

SHE
KNOWS
GREAT
FOOD
AND
DINING
EXPERIENCES
.
She
was
dead
on
--
this
restaurant
was
wonderful
---
do
not
be
put
off
by
the
one
negative
review
on
this
page
.
I
can
tell
you
we
were
pleasantly
surprised
--
BT
has
taste
memory
and
each
time
back
the
food
was
consistently
delicious
--
same
dishes
--
were
consistent
.
Our
friend
is
a
world
traveler
and
loves
unpretentious
dining
experiences
and
inspired
food
.
This
chef
knows
what
he
is
doing
.
Treat
yourself
and
go
--
you
will
go
back
!
I
am
a
business
owner
in
downtown
Saratoga
Springs
and
wish
this
restaurant
was
in
our
town
!
The
affordable
rent
makes
it
possible
for
an
inspired
chef
to
serve
his
high
quality
fare
at
affordable
prices
!
Unlike
Saratoga
.
Can
not
wait
to
go
gain

I
think
that
the
re
pretty
good
.
First
of
all
,
if
you
call
for
an
appointment
they
wo
n't
tell
you
to
call
back
a
month
later
so
you
can
then
make
one
.
They
also
do
n't
tell
you
that
they
're
going
to
mail
you
an
"
application
"
to
be
admitted
to
be
a
patient
.
Usually
you
can
be
seen
the
same
week
or
maybe
the
following
week
.
The
doctor
did
tell
me
that
my
male
pattern
baldness
is
due
to
my
mother
s
father
because
the
gene
is
exclusively
passed
on
through
maternal
line
but
that
's
a
common
misconception
(
http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm
)
.
In
general
I
would
say
that
the
staff
is
attentive
and
nice
.
But
then
again
I
was
nice
to
them
so
that
could
have
been
why
.
If
you
want
miracles
you
'll
have
to
go
to
21st
St
.
It
's
a
pretty
typical
primary
care
office
but
for
the
area
it
's
very
good
.
They
do
n't
do
certain
things
that
are
really
annoying
about
other
offices
.
First
trip
to
Canada
I
recently
traveled
to
Canada
on
business
and
had
a
most
excellent
experience
.
I
work
for
a
large
retail
company
recently
expanding
our
operations
into
Canada
and
had
to
travel
to
ensure
all
of
our
computer
network
equipment
was
installed
properly
and
on
time
.
I
was
very
pleased
to
find
my
accommodations
and
the
hotel
staff
to
be
a
very
calming
and
comforting
part
of
my
trip
.
I
found
the
hotel
to
be
amazingly
clean
,
not
to
mention
very
well
adorned
with
many
pleasant
surprises
.
From
my
first
encounter
at
check
in
to
my
regrettable
check
out
I
found
the
staff
and
facility
to
exceed
my
expectation
.
I
completely
enjoyed
my
whole
check
in
experience
and
was
impressed
with
the
friendliness
and
professionalism
of
the
staff
as
well
as
the
accommodations
themselves
.
I
will
be
traveling
in
this
area
in
the
future
and
you
can
be
assured
that
this
experience
will
be
helpful
in
my
choice
of
hotels
and
Novotel
will
be
my
first
selection
.
Yes
the
parking
can
be
a
challenge
but
being
from
NJ
I
am
no
stranger
to
tight
corners
.
Please
pass
my
appreciation
to
the
Staff
and
Management
for
their
excellent
hospitality
and
good
spirits
as
it
helped
make
a
stressful
trip
enjoyable
.
Favorite
place

Update
:
I
had
to
add
to
my
review
.
I
was
just
in
last
night
and
had
a
chance
to
dine
in
their
new
dining
room
.
AMAZING
!
Well
I
was
in
for
a
treat
when
I
was
greeted
by
the
friendly
girls
at
the
counter
who
asked
if
my
wife
and
I
would
like
to
sit
in
their
"
new
"
dining
room
.
Right
away
they
told
us
that
it
was
the
same
great
food
with
the
same
prices
so
off
we
went
.
We
were
greeted
again
and
sat
promptly
.
After
looking
at
the
menu
and
seeing
the
new
menu
items
they
had
,
we
knew
we
were
in
for
a
treat
!
I
had
the
Chicken
Parmesan
Dinner
and
my
wife
had
the
Shrimp
Scampi
Dinner
.
AMAZING
!
The
portions
were
generous
enough
that
we
even
took
some
home
!
I
have
to
say
the
value
of
this
place
always
amazes
me
.
It
's
nice
to
see
that
even
in
the
economy
we
can
eat
a
place
that
has
upscale
service
,
amazing
atmosphere
,
and
Incredible
food
,
but
not
break
the
bank
while
enjoying
it
!
Well
Done
!
Great
work
and
honest
establishment
!
I
typically
have
work
done
on
my
Jeep
at
the
dealership
,
but
it
is
6
years
old
now
and
getting
charged
dealership
prices
just
did
n't
seem
cost
effective
anymore
.
I
had
tried
out
few
place
around
the
area
and
had
been
ripped
off
a
few
times
.
I
had
hear
great
things
about
Phet
and
G&G
Automotive
so
I
decided
to
give
him
a
try
.
The
service
was
excellent
and
personable
.
He
checked
out
what
I
needed
to
have
done
told
me
what
needed
be
fixed
before
he
did
any
work
and
did
great
repair
work
.
The
price
was
actually
lower
than
what
I
had
anticipated
and
used
to
compared
to
other
places
,
plus
he
showed
me
the
work
he
did
when
I
came
in
to
pick
up
the
car
.
Also
,
a
week
after
the
work
,
Phet
called
me
up
to
see
how
my
car
was
running
and
to
let
me
know
that
they
had
accidentally
overcharged
me
for
part
of
the
work
and
wanted
to
give
me
a
refund
for
that
amount
.
That
is
just
unheard
of
these
days
!
I
grew
up
in
a
small
town
where
you
knew
and
trusted
your
mechanic
and
was
really
cynical
about
city
auto
repair
shops
since
I
moved
here
,
but
Phet
has
shown
that
there
really
are
honest
hard
working
mechanics
around
.
He
is
my
mechanic
going
forward
!
Our
company
is
a
high
end
designer
handbag
and
fashion
accessories
company
,
thus
we
are
certainly
a
niche
market
.
We
had
been
evaluating
SEO
providers
for
quite
some
time
and
finally
decided
to
take
the
plunge
with
Stuart
,
and
Ulistic
.
We
made
the
decision
for
a
couple
of
reasons
.
1
.
Social
Media
.
2
.
We
really
liked
the
fact
that
Stuart
sets
defined
objectives
and
we
meet
once
a
month
to
go
over
our
Key
Performance
Indicators
.
How
has
it
gone
so
far
?
Well
we
have
been
working
with
Ulistic
for
1.5
months
,
and
have
100
people
following
our
site
on
Facebook
,
and
our
web
site
,
www.designofashion.com
has
seen
a
3
fold
increase
in
traffic
,
which
is
significantly
beating
our
expectations
-
SEO
is
a
process
that
takes
time
and
to
get
results
this
quickly
is
exceptional
.
Excellent
service
and
quality
I
had
Hom
-
Excel
replace
most
of
the
windows
in
my
Tampa
residence
three
years
ago
.
The
excellent
windows
have
performed
without
any
problems
,
but
that
's
not
why
I
'm
writing
my
review
.
Three
weeks
ago
,
burglars
tried
to
gain
entry
into
the
rear
of
my
home
.
The
intruders
slit
the
screen
of
the
window
.
Next
,
they
tried
to
force
the
window
with
a
pry
bar
and
then
to
break
the
window
with
a
hammer
.
The
window
did
n't
break
!
My
next
-
door
neighbor
heard
the
noise
and
turned
on
a
light
,
thankfully
scaring
the
two
miscreants
away
(
they
even
left
their
hammer
behind
!
)
.
Lo
and
behold
,
they
replaced
the
screen
(
which
had
to
be
ordered
)
yesterday
and
did
n't
charge
me
a
dime
.
Their
worker
even
cleaned
3
of
my
windows
and
changed
a
lightbulb
for
me
.
In
this
day
and
age
,
it
is
so
rare
to
find
a
company
with
such
nice
workers
and
such
far
ranging
guarantee
policies
.
I
rarely
write
reviews
such
as
this
one
,
but
they
certainly
deserve
anyone
's
business
!
Friendly
staff
,
but
definitely
some
problems
May
,
2009
.
We
were
booked
at
the
Sheraton
with
a
number
of
other
out
-
of
-
town
wedding
guests
.
Got
put
into
the
wrong
room
the
first
night
,
and
were
quite
surprised
to
have
someone
with
the
same
room
key
trying
to
get
in
the
door
at
1:00
am
!
Next
day
got
moved
into
another
room
,
on
the
same
floor
with
other
wedding
guests
.
A
package
and
some
wedding
cards
were
left
in
our
first
room
.
They
were
sent
to
our
second
room
and
had
been
opened
--
the
ribbon
-
wrapped
present
,
and
all
3
envelopes
.
Security
in
the
hotel
seemed
to
be
excellent
,
but
we
were
never
given
an
explanation
as
to
why
someone
would
open
these
items
.
A
mid-afternoon
"
fire
drill
"
was
disruptive
,
putting
everyone
out
of
the
hotel
.
When
we
called
the
front
desk
about
an
extremely
boisterous
crowd
in
the
hall
outside
our
door
quite
late
at
night
,
it
seemed
to
take
the
hotel
staff
quite
a
while
to
quiet
them
down
.
The
staff
was
friendly
,
especially
the
front
desk
female
supervisor
,
and
seemed
to
want
to
help
,
but
too
many
unusual
things
happened
to
make
us
want
to
stay
there
again
.
Be
Careful
Of
Who
Your
Sales
Guy
Is
I
think
this
place
is
probably
really
great
especially
judging
by
the
reviews
on
here
.
My
experience
was
awful
though
.
It
ALL
had
to
do
with
the
sales
guy
which
was
a
young
22
year
old
who
had
admittedly
only
been
working
for
2
weeks
.
I
was
extremely
interested
in
the
car
and
very
likely
would
have
bought
it
,
but
the
sales
guy
I
dealt
with
ruined
the
deal
.
Essentially
,
I
told
him
I
did
n't
trust
him
cause
he
was
a
car
salesman
,
but
he
got
so
incredibly
offended
at
that
statement
that
he
had
to
go
cry
to
another
salesman
and
compose
himself
before
coming
back
.
I
do
n't
know
if
the
kid
had
a
bad
day
or
what
,
but
I
had
to
sit
and
apologize
about
nothing
for
10
minutes
until
he
dropped
the
issue
.
After
that
,
I
just
tried
to
ignore
his
lack
of
professionalism
and
test
drive
the
car
.
I
played
dumb
and
asked
him
questions
that
I
already
knew
the
answers
to
and
he
responded
with
half
truths
and
a
few
falsehoods
.
For
instance
I
asked
who
owned
Mazda
and
he
said
with
confidence
that
was
GM
,
which
is
n't
true
.
I
mean
,
I
do
n't
care
if
he
does
n't
know
,
but
if
he
pretends
to
know
and
tells
me
BS
to
my
face
,
there
's
no
way
I
'm
going
to
trust
him
when
matters
turn
to
the
price
of
the
car
and
financing
.
The
service
stunk
.
I
called
in
my
order
and
upon
arriving
to
pick
it
up
,
they
got
my
order
confused
with
someone
else
s
.
They
helped
about
three
other
people
before
they
offered
to
help
me
again
.
They
also
got
my
friend
s
order
mixed
up
and
wanted
to
charger
her
$
10
more
than
what
she
had
wanted
.
She
asked
for
the
dinner
combo
and
they
gave
her
two
dinner
plates
instead
.
We
were
standing
in
the
store
for
20
minutes
to
simply
pick
up
an
order
.
Not
to
mention
that
the
wait
staff
was
about
as
pleasant
as
dealing
with
an
angry
bull
.
They
were
abrasive
and
rude
-
when
they
were
the
ones
who
messed
everything
up
.
We
had
to
throw
out
about
80
percent
of
our
meals
because
the
food
tasted
so
horrible
.
I
do
nt
know
how
it
is
possible
to
make
orange
chicken
,
sesame
chicken
and
kung
pao
chicken
as
well
as
cheese
puffs
taste
THAT
bad
but
China
Delight
accomplished
that
.
The
only
thing
that
was
edible
was
the
steamed
rice
and
the
vegetable
lo
mein
was
barely
tolerable
.
I
will
NEVER
go
here
again
.
I
have
no
idea
how
China
Delight
won
number
1
Chinese
restaurant
in
Montgomery
-
There
needs
to
be
a
recount
on
that
vote
.
Terrible
Service
We
took
our
vehicle
in
for
a
repair
to
the
air
conditioning
.
Approx
4
months
later
,
the
compressor
went
out
.
We
took
it
back
in
to
have
it
repaired
again
,
and
less
than
a
week
later
the
second
compressor
went
out
.
We
went
in
for
a
third
visit
and
they
fixed
it
again
,
but
this
time
when
we
picked
up
the
car
,
the
radio
and
clock
did
not
work
.
So
for
the
4th
time
in
5
months
and
the
third
time
in
2
weeks
,
we
brought
the
car
back
again
.
When
we
expressed
our
discontent
to
the
manager
(
that
's
right
,
the
manager
)
,
did
he
say
he
would
return
some
money
,
did
he
say
he
would
give
a
discount
on
our
next
visit
,
did
he
just
say
"
I
'm
sorry
"
.
Nope
,
none
of
the
above
.
He
stood
there
and
told
us
how
he
was
n't
at
fault
.
And
what
did
we
expect
...
that
he
bench
test
every
part
.
At
no
time
during
the
conversation
did
the
words
,
"
I
'm
sorry
"
ever
come
out
of
his
mouth
.
I
,
nor
anyone
else
in
my
family
,
will
ever
go
to
Sun
Devil
Auto
again
.
Well
,
unless
of
course
the
third
compressor
he
put
in
the
car
goes
out
.
Do
not
use
this
company
!
I
dropped
off
a
sheet
metal
piece
that
I
needed
copied
due
to
th
it
was
needing
to
be
replaced
.
I
asked
if
they
could
copy
the
piece
I
dropped
off
.
They
said
it
would
be
made
exactly
like
the
one
I
needed
to
replace
.
I
picked
it
up
when
it
was
finished
and
was
charge
30.00
.
When
I
got
to
the
job
and
tried
to
insert
the
new
piece
of
metal
IT
WOULD
NOT
FIT
!!
I
took
the
original
piece
of
metal
and
rigged
it
to
make
due
since
I
had
to
complete
the
job
.
I
took
the
receipt
and
the
metal
that
did
not
fit
and
asked
Pomper
for
my
money
back
.
The
girl
at
the
desk
was
sooo
rude
I
could
not
believe
it
!
She
told
me
she
could
not
use
the
piece
I
was
returning
and
the
company
would
only
put
it
in
the
trash
so
I
could
not
return
it
.
I
explained
I
did
not
get
what
I
paid
for
.
She
asked
me
to
bring
the
original
piece
back
and
I
told
her
I
had
to
use
it
on
the
job
.
She
told
me
that
was
to
bad
she
would
do
nothing
to
help
me
since
she
could
not
use
or
resell
the
piece
.
I
said
I
was
going
to
trash
it
also
and
could
I
at
least
have
a
credit
.
With
a
smirk
on
her
face
she
told
me
NO
MONEY
IS
BEING
RETURNED
and
THAT
IS
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
.
DO
NOT
USE
THIS
COMPANY
.
There
are
to
many
people
that
need
our
business
to
have
to
put
up
with
this
unfair
treatment
!!!!!
I
would
NEVER
recommend
this
gym
to
anyone
and
unfortunately
this
is
based
solely
on
the
owner
's
own
unprofessionalism
.
When
I
originally
joined
in
January
I
only
did
so
because
I
was
told
I
would
be
able
to
cancel
the
12
month
membership
if
I
was
to
move
away
.
I
signed
up
with
one
of
the
staff
who
was
very
pleasant
and
professional
.
Actually
working
out
there
was
good
-
the
machines
are
nice
and
the
classes
are
fun
.
The
locker
room
is
certainly
lacking
-
I
would
never
shower
or
change
there
.
They
need
to
update
the
locker
rooms
ASAP
.
Back
to
my
poor
rating
-
I
was
excepted
to
medical
school
and
went
in
to
cancel
my
membership
as
I
was
told
I
could
do
since
I
was
moving
away
.
The
owner
was
VERY
rude
,
accused
me
of
not
reading
my
contract
,
and
basically
told
me
to
shut
up
when
I
was
trying
to
ask
questions
to
further
understand
the
process
of
canceling
my
membership
.
I
was
able
to
cancel
it
but
only
after
paying
a
$
50
fee
(
which
the
staff
person
who
signed
me
up
stated
I
would
not
have
to
pay
if
I
had
proof
of
moving
)
and
being
spoken
to
in
a
very
belittling
manner
.
I
would
understand
if
I
was
being
treated
this
way
by
a
staff
member
but
the
club
's
actual
OWNER
?!
Bad
for
business
.
I
was
appalled
.
I
will
never
recommend
this
gym
to
any
woman
.
The
equipment
and
classes
are
n't
good
enough
to
deal
with
the
rudeness
from
the
staff
!!!
The
Salon
Experience
from
Hell
I
feel
obligated
to
share
this
story
.
Right
out
of
college
I
called
the
salon
and
explained
my
situation
.
Just
graduated
,
just
moved
,
not
rich
,
and
starting
new
job
soon
.
I
never
got
a
price
quote
over
the
phone
and
they
take
your
cc
info
just
to
make
the
appointment
because
if
you
do
n't
show
up
,
they
'll
charge
you
.
I
had
this
ridiculous
celebrity
stylist
from
LA
named
Derrick
.
After
he
already
put
product
on
my
hair
he
said
"
I
should
warn
you
,
I
'm
expensive
.
"
What
was
I
supposed
to
do
,
say
I
ca
n't
afford
you
and
walk
out
with
crap
all
over
my
hair
.
I
wanted
to
be
very
blonde
and
instead
he
pulled
my
root
color
throughout
my
whole
hair
which
is
a
gross
mousey
brown
.
The
other
stylists
around
me
kept
pressuring
me
saying
he
's
so
wonderful
,
you
're
going
to
love
your
hair
.
$
400
later
my
jaw
dropped
when
the
receptionist
told
me
the
total
.
Derrick
did
a
terrible
job
,
was
a
complete
jerk
the
entire
time
,
and
I
had
no
warning
as
to
the
price
.
I
cried
the
entire
way
home
.
He
then
"
fixed
"
it
for
free
but
it
still
looked
like
crap
.
I
will
never
go
back
.
It
was
the
salon
experience
from
absolutely
Hell
.
He
also
told
me
that
he
worked
on
the
cast
of
will
and
grace
and
that
they
were
all
jerks
.
That
's
my
favorite
show
of
all
time
.
I
'm
pretty
sure
for
the
cast
that
it
was
the
other
way
around
.
Maybe
he
did
n't
do
a
good
job
and
they
told
him
so
.
Absolute
Nightmare
!
STAY
AWAY
!
Very
unhappy
...
Working
with
Rod
Jacobsen
was
my
first
experience
working
with
a
CPA
,
so
I
did
not
know
what
to
expect
.
That
said
-
he
seemed
to
be
doing
well
enough
.
However
,
then
I
asked
to
amend
my
return
to
apply
a
credit
I
had
just
become
eligible
for
.
I
expected
to
pay
for
this
service
,
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
I
received
a
bill
for
MORE
than
what
I
paid
to
have
the
original
return
prepared
.
Well
,
that
was
strike
one
.
I
was
n't
going
to
use
them
again
,
but
I
was
going
to
leave
it
at
that
.
However
,
now
that
I
have
come
to
realize
that
I
am
going
to
owe
the
IRS
$
6,000
+
despite
doing
exactly
what
Rod
told
me
to
do
,
I
feel
I
have
to
voice
my
opinion
.
Last
year
,
after
all
was
said
and
done
,
I
asked
Rod
whether
my
payment
structure
would
leave
me
with
no
/
little
tax
liability
at
the
end
of
the
year
.
He
said
yes
.
Well
,
again
,
I
am
now
faced
with
a
tax
bill
of
$
6,000
+
,
all
due
on
April
15
,
2010
and
all
that
Rod
has
to
say
to
the
matter
is
'
well
,
you
wo
n't
have
to
pay
a
penalty
.
'
I
may
not
have
to
pay
a
penalty
,
yet
,
but
this
is
NOT
what
I
had
in
mind
when
hired
these
guys
.
In
the
words
of
my
new
accountant
,
THEY
LET
ME
DOWN
!
Bit
sketchy
,
sporadic
delivery
times
I
bought
about
half
of
the
furniture
I
own
from
this
place
.
Why
?
Because
they
cut
me
good
deals
if
I
paid
in
cash
.
Sketchy
,
right
?
Well
they
came
through
and
delivered
almost
all
of
my
items
within
a
few
days
.
(
They
even
got
me
a
couch
pretty
quickly
.
)
The
guy
who
was
cutting
me
the
deals
and
getting
me
the
furniture
quickly
,
Ahmed
,
was
nice
and
mostly
professional
,
except
the
semi-sketchiness
.
Then
one
day
,
Ahmed
left
the
country
,
not
to
return
for
months
,
WITHOUT
informing
me
.
He
also
neglected
to
tell
the
other
person
working
at
the
store
about
a
dining
room
table
that
I
had
ordered
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
coming
in
.
The
other
person
working
at
the
store
did
n't
know
that
I
still
had
this
table
coming
.
I
had
paid
in
cash
,
and
he
said
he
had
no
receipt
/
record
of
my
purchase
.
I
came
back
with
the
receipt
Ahmed
had
provided
upon
my
purchase
,
and
the
guy
took
forever
to
copy
it
but
said
that
he
would
take
care
of
the
situation
.
I
waited
.
And
waited
.
He
never
once
contacted
us
.
I
've
had
to
pester
this
new
guy
several
times
to
ask
when
my
table
will
arrive
.
He
kept
saying
different
arrival
/
delivery
dates
and
did
n't
seem
terribly
apologetic
.
It
has
been
3
weeks
and
I
STILL
do
n't
have
my
table
(
which
was
NOT
cheap
,
I
might
add
)
.
Point
is
:
You
might
be
able
to
get
a
good
deal
on
some
nice
furniture
--
which
I
did
--
but
they
're
not
very
communicative
and
god
forbid
something
goes
wrong
,
you
'll
have
to
fight
to
get
it
resolved
.
Poor
Service
Run
do
n't
walk
.
My
experience
with
Home
Delivery
Service
has
been
one
of
disappointment
and
anger
.
If
I
could
give
them
a
lower
rating
than
poor
I
would
.
On
August
21st
,
2009
I
ordered
furniture
from
Hickory
Furniture
Mart
and
contracted
for
HDS
to
deliver
it
.
After
seventeen
days
the
delivery
van
showed
up
at
my
home
minus
two
pieces
.
I
was
later
told
they
had
been
left
at
the
warehouse
and
some
future
date
they
would
be
delivered
.
No
one
will
give
me
a
date
.
I
spent
$
2300
on
the
bedroom
suite
,
which
was
complete
and
excellent
condition
on
the
showroom
floor
.
How
do
you
lose
a
drawer
.
After
complaining
on
September
10th
to
National
Home
Furnishings
,
Boyles
,
the
Hickory
Furniture
Mart
and
Home
Delivery
Service
the
latter
finally
called
me
back
and
said
they
would
be
up
to
pick
the
dresser
and
chest
of
drawers
at
some
future
point
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
professional
repaired
and
at
some
later
point
it
would
be
returned
.
The
customer
service
at
Home
Delivery
Service
was
terrible
let
alone
their
promise
to
proper
set
up
furniture
.
So
I
am
in
limbo
regarding
a
bedroom
suite
.
Maybe
then
they
will
begin
to
understand
poor
customer
service
and
terrible
sit
up
service
.
Excellent
Driving
School
I
was
involved
in
a
car
accident
20
years
ago
and
since
then
I
've
been
a
nervous
wreck
and
have
n't
been
behind
the
wheel
.
Unfortunately
,
a
family
emergency
required
me
to
conquer
this
fear
.
A
very
good
friend
of
mine
highly
recommended
the
Professional
Driving
School
and
I
was
told
to
specifically
ask
for
Gerry
.
I
called
the
school
most
probably
10
times
before
I
finally
enrolled
in
a
20
hour
package
.
I
had
to
cancel
my
initial
lesson
4
times
and
on
the
5th
attempt
the
management
was
quick
enough
to
associate
my
cancellations
with
my
fear
and
finally
encouraged
me
into
taking
my
initial
lesson
.
Five
minutes
before
my
initial
lesson
,
I
got
a
call
from
Gerry
advising
me
of
his
arrival
and
to
come
down
as
soon
as
I
was
ready
.
My
heart
pounded
as
I
walked
down
and
pounded
even
faster
upon
seeing
Gerry
in
an
SUV
-
Lexus
!
I
thought
of
canceling
the
lesson
once
again
because
I
did
n't
feel
comfortable
driving
an
SUV
.
Gerry
pleasantly
said
"
since
I
am
already
here
why
do
n't
we
give
it
shot
.
I
trust
you
and
believe
that
you
'll
be
able
to
handle
this
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
reciprocate
!
Trust
me
and
most
especially
trust
and
believe
in
yourself
.
Do
n't
worry
,
I
'll
take
care
of
you
!
"
.......
the
rest
was
history
!
Here
I
am
now
driving
confidently
on
my
own
.
Gerry
,
I
ca
n't
thank
you
enough
for
helping
me
cope
with
my
fear
.
Review
on
House
of
Joy
Chinese
Restaurant
My
family
and
I
moved
to
San
Antonio
a
year
ago
and
have
tried
almost
all
of
the
Chinese
Restaurants
because
we
love
Chinese
food
.
Well
it
took
us
a
while
to
find
one
that
we
liked
.
But
we
do
n't
just
like
House
of
Joy
WE
LOVE
IT
.
Everything
we
have
gotten
there
has
been
more
authentic
and
better
tasting
than
any
other
Chinese
restaurant
in
the
San
Antonio
area
we
have
been
to
--
and
trust
me
we
have
been
to
a
lot
of
them
.
We
just
happen
to
stumble
across
this
little
restaurant
one
day
when
we
had
to
visit
the
Bexar
County
Tax
Office
off
of
Bandera
Road
.
We
stopped
in
and
got
some
take
out
and
can
not
stop
going
back
.
We
also
love
their
Egg
Rolls
and
Spring
Rolls
.
And
every
entree
we
have
ordered
is
perfect
.
Everything
is
always
cooked
fresh
and
tastes
fresh
.
Their
prices
are
extremely
reasonable
for
the
amount
of
food
you
receive
.
The
staff
is
also
just
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
.
They
are
also
quick
at
getting
your
order
out
to
you
.
You
do
n't
have
to
sit
and
wait
around
forever
like
most
places
!!
So
anyone
looking
for
an
Excellent
night
out
for
Chinese
or
maybe
just
lunch
should
stop
in
and
try
it
because
I
promise
you
2
things
---
You
wo
n't
regret
it
!!
and
you
will
go
back
for
more
!!!

PS
I
have
noticed
on
here
that
someone
left
a
comment
that
"
all
of
the
nice
comments
must
come
from
co
workers
or
friends
"
and
I
will
tell
you
that
I
do
n't
know
these
people
except
from
eating
at
their
restaurant
.
We
are
from
Virginia
and
just
moved
here
a
year
ago
.
So
that
comment
is
completely
false
.
and
we
do
n't
know
them
except
for
eating
there
.
Dr.
Strzalka
at
Flagship
CVTS
is
not
a
good
doctor
I
am
not
sure
about
the
quality
of
the
other
doctors
there
,
but
i
do
know
from
personal
experience
that
Dr.
Christopher
T.
Strzalka
is
not
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
is
also
very
CRUEL
AND
UNCARING
!!
He
was
going
to
operate
and
replace
my
bicuspid
aortic
valve
due
to
critical
aortic
stenosis
.
I
had
a
surgery
date
of
July
17
,
2008
.
Then
he
renigged
when
he
read
my
Health
Care
Proxy
,
even
though
i
agreed
to
be
on
the
ventilator
for
2
months
following
surgery
(
as
he
had
twice
stated
i
must
agree
to
)
.
He
later
said
that
by
2
months
he
"
meant
at
least
two
months
"
.
Two
months
and
at
least
two
months
are
totally
different
things
.
He
did
not
even
give
me
the
chance
to
say
i
would
stay
on
the
ventilator
longer
,
which
i
would
have
.
A
Health
Care
Proxy
is
not
written
in
stone
and
can
be
changed
.
He
also
never
even
said
he
was
sorry
.
Just
said
i
was
inoperable
and
walked
out
of
the
hospital
room
.
So
,
therefore
,
now
he
says
i
am
inoperable
(
even
though
i
am
not
100
%
inoperable
)
,
and
he
is
letting
me
die
.
I
am
just
middle
aged
and
do
not
want
to
die
,
but
thanks
to
this
doctor
i
have
no
other
alternatives
.
I
,
along
with
my
friends
,
consider
this
doctor
to
be
the
cause
of
my
death
as
he
is
not
even
trying
to
save
my
life
by
operating
.
Even
my
PA
i
went
to
the
other
day
said
"
it
must
by
comforting
to
have
gone
to
a
heart
surgeon
like
him
who
will
do
nothing
for
you
"
.
He
said
it
sarcastically
.
If
you
want
a
doctor
who
will
lie
to
you
and
say
he
will
operate
and
then
change
his
mind
,
and
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
when
he
recommends
procedures
at
other
hospitals
and
says
they
are
what
you
need
,
when
they
will
not
work
for
you
,
go
to
this
doctor
...
he
is
the
one
for
you
.
What
you
can
learn
from
the
below
'
bad
experience
'
.
I
would
suggest
not
avoiding
Second
Home
based
on
the
'
bad
experience
'
review
.
I
'd
probably
be
more
inclined
to
board
my
two
dogs
here
,
seeing
that
they
do
n't
just
take
every
dog
coming
in
.
I
've
toured
this
place
and
was
impressed
by
how
clean
the
place
was
,
and
all
the
options
for
the
dogs
.
It
's
unfortunate
that
bmil
believed
that
his
'
perfect
'
dog
was
not
given
the
right
opportunity
to
prove
himself
.
But
I
've
done
hundreds
of
dog
introductions
myself
(
another
place
,
I
do
n't
work
here
)
,
and
owners
can
have
unrealistic
expectations
and
views
of
what
they
see
when
their
dogs
meet
other
dogs
.
Workers
who
do
these
introductions
look
at
the
interaction
objectively
;
and
it
's
good
to
see
they
are
able
and
willing
to
say
no
if
they
feel
there
would
be
a
problem
.
It
sounds
(
according
to
your
own
statement
)
that
they
had
a
roomful
of
dogs
,
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
-
and
are
keeping
those
dogs
safe
from
potential
problems
.
You
say
you
work
a
lot
,
and
that
you
have
a
young
dog
;
so
I
have
little
doubt
that
your
dog
is
just
filled
with
energy
to
burn
;
and
it
is
good
of
you
to
look
for
a
place
to
take
him
.
But
not
at
a
risk
to
other
people
's
pets
.
You
were
clearly
given
another
alternative
by
Second
Home
,
to
board
him
-
which
might
have
given
your
dog
a
chance
to
come
and
go
from
Second
Home
a
couple
times
,
getting
used
to
the
place
and
maybe
facilitating
another
attempt
to
get
into
daycare
later
.
No
business
is
going
to
push
customers
away
without
good
reason
;
so
is
n't
it
reasonable
to
think
they
might
know
what
they
're
doing
?
My
dogs
are
far
from
perfect
,
and
one
of
them
I
believe
would
be
a
little
much
for
daycare
here
herself
(
at
least
initially
)
.
Be
a
little
more
reasonable
with
your
expectations
of
a
place
like
this
;
and
maybe
do
n't
jump
to
personal
attacks
suggesting
that
they
do
n't
want
to
work
hard
,
just
because
you
bruised
your
own
ego
.
I
called
dominos
tonight
,
it
rang
forever
,
I
get
put
on
hold
twice
without
saying
a
word
and
FINALLY
someone
says
,
MAY
I
HELP
YOU
?
So
I
say
:
I
'm
at
the
Radison
Warwick
hotel
in
Rittenhouse
Square
(
built
in
1926
)
do
you
deliver
to
the
Warwick
?
They
say
no
,
Warwick
in
New
Jersey
,
Call
New
Jersey
.
I
laugh
and
say
,
no
,
that
Warwick
is
in
New
York
,
but
I
'm
at
the
Radison

And
he
says
:
You
're
at
Warwick
in
Pennsylvania
?
and
I
said
,
YES
,
CENTER
CITY
PHILLY
,
and
he
says
,
NO

is
a

HOTEL
in
Rittenhouse

He
says
:

PHILLY
.

He
gives
the

to
a

,
she
says

I
say

YES

mile
west

.
I
am

of
Walnut
.
She
says
,
Is
that
17th
like
over
past
broad
.
YES
,
I
am
west
of
broad
.
Broad
,
I
say
,
is
14th
street
and
I
am
3
blocks
west
of
broad
and
one
south
of
walnut
.
Hmmm
,
she
says
,
Then
why
are
you
calling
here
,
we
do
n't
go
past
broad
?
Anyway
,
after
much
yelling
and
cussing
I
hung
up
,
grabbed
a
cab
,
and
went
to
Geno
's
.
Quick
to
take
money
but
not
quick
to
fix
a
problem
!
B&B
came
out
very
quickly
to
give
us
our
quote
back
in
June
.
They
were
very
polite
,
eager
to
answer
any
questions
and
willing
to
wait
for
us
to
return
from
vacation
to
begin
installing
our
fence
.
Our
fence
was
installed
quickly
in
August
and
they
had
their
money
and
left
saying
"
Workmanship
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
!
"
.
Within
a
week
we
noticed
one
of
the
boards
on
our
gate
splitting
where
a
nail
had
gone
in
.
We
called
our
representative
who
assured
me
he
would
call
the
office
and
have
it
taken
care
of
.
We
heard
nothing
.
We
then
called
the
office
and
the
man
we
spoke
to
said
he
'd
send
someone
out
to
look
at
it
but
could
n't
promise
when
-
two
weeks
came
and
went
and
we
heard
nothing
.
I
just
called
again
and
was
told
that
workmanship
,
not
wood
,
is
guaranteed
for
a
year
-
well
in
my
opinion
-
the
wood
split
due
to
a
nail
which
is
part
of
workmanship
!
She
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
"
You
r
calling
about
one
board
?
"
Well
-
when
you
pay
over
$
1000
for
something
you
want
it
to
hold
up
and
look
good
!!!
YES
!
I
WAS
calling
about
one
board
!!
So
I
figure
if
they
do
n't
want
to
take
the
time
to
fix
the
fence
that
they
installed
then
I
'll
take
the
time
to
let
everyone
I
can
know
about
how
they
treat
customers
once
they
have
your
money
!!!
STAY
AWAY
!!!
YOU
GET
WHAT
YOU
PAY
FOR
!!!
They
came
in
under
a
lot
of
other
quotes
and
now
I
know
why
!!!
When
the
fence
was
first
installed
I
would
have
given
them
five
stars
,
now
for
their
poor
customer
follow
-
up
and
unwillingness
to
fix
the
fence
they
have
dropped
to
a
one
-
star
in
my
opinion
!
Lots
of
rules
,
phantom
innkeeper
,
last
minute
price
was
worth
it
.
I
called
the
"
207
"
number
and
listened
to
the
same
recording
loop
3
times
before
I
gave
up
.
I
then
called
the
800
number
(
which
was
answered
)
and
inquired
about
last
minute
rates
.
They
had
a
room
with
a
$
99
rate
,
which
I
booked
.
The
room
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
2nd
floor
,
but
they
put
us
on
the
3rd
.
In
other
words
,
they
do
not
help
with
suitcases
,
but
they
promise
totes
to
help
.
However
upon
our
arrival
no
one
there
(
the
inn
was
open
)
.
So
no
totes
.
Finally
a
chambermaid
stuck
her
head
around
the
corner
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
told
us
sternly
that
we
could
not
be
accommodated
until
3
M
,
no
exceptions
.
Then
she
was
gone
.
We
returned
after
3
PM
,
found
no
one
there
,
and
a
note
from
the
innkeeper
with
directions
to
our
room
.
Rules
in
the

you

soda
from
the

in
your

trash
.
If
they
think
you
've
taken
a

your
room
home
with
you
,
they
will
charge
you
$
1.50

Breakfast
is
8
AM
to
10
AM
.
No
earlier
and
no
later
.
If
you
go
later
,
it
's
all
cleaned
up
.
(
By
whom
,
I
do
n't
know
.
I
never
saw
anyone
there
.
All
these
rules
are
posted
in
the
rooms
.
)
Snacks
:
uninspired
bread
,
tea
backs
,
and
individual
coffee
things
for
a
machine
that
did
n't
exist
.
I
put
the
coffee
thing
in
hot
water
and
settled
for
a
cup
of
weak
coffee
.
No
wine
glasses
.
Room
was
clean
,
but
had
a
weird
,
dated
,
sink
/
stove
combo
that
did
n't
work
.
Bath
was
clean
except
shower
stall
which
had
mildew
problems
.
No
tub
.
The
Inn
touts
a
shower
with
dual
shower
heads
,
but
only
one
worked
.
Do
n't
get
the
rooms
off
the
two
kitchens
.
They
are
RIGHT
OFF
the
kitchen
so
you
hear
everything
.
Free
parking
.
I
'd
go
back
if
I
could
get
the
last
minute
rate
again
of
$
99
,
but
I
would
n't
pay
their
rack
rate
.
The
truth
is
,
in
my
and
my
dining
partners
'
experience
,
this
is
a
fine
little
restaurant
with
some
unique
food
.
It
's
an
entirely
up
and
down
experience
,
however
.
The
salatim
salads
are
the
smallest
plates
I
've
ever
seen
placed
in
front
of
me
(
you
would
most
likely
think
they
were
condiments
if
it
were
n't
explained
to
you
)
.
Though
they
are
mostly
excellent
,
you
generally
do
n't
get
enough
forkfuls
to
know
if
you
really
love
them
.
That
being
said
,
the
laffa
and
hummus
are
out
of
this
world
.
Then
again
,
for
the
three
of
us
who
dined
together
,
two
pieces
of
flatbread
left
us
fighting
for
more
,
and
licking
the
hummus
from
our
fingers
(
and
yes
,
those
two
pieces
of
flatbread
did
represent
a
three
-
person
order
)
.
Dinner
was
also
an
up
-
and
-
down
experience
.
The
vegetarian
dishes
and
lighter
fare
were
almost
always
spot
-
on
,
while
the
lamb
was
often
dry
and
/
or
overcooked
.
The
duck
was
a
65
%
glob
of
chewy
fat
with
no
resemblance
to
the
juicy
,
crispy
delicacy
it
usually
represents
at
other
establishments
.
Dessert
was
...
hmmm
,
that
's
interesting
,
I
do
n't
even
remember
dessert
.
I
guess
that
tells
you
a
lot
.
Oh
,
yes
,
the
chocolate
semifreddo
was
quite
good
.
The
warm
chocolate
cake
was
very
tasty
,
but
served
at
room
temperature
,
not
warm
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
.
And
my
--
no
,
I
still
do
n't
remember
what
I
had
.
Perhaps
had
we
not
gone
into
this
restaurant
believing
Zahav
was
going
to
be
golden
as
its
name
suggests
(
and
as
the
many
golden
reviews
seem
to
attest
)
,
we
would
have
enjoyed
a
decent
little
expensive
experience
.
PS
)
When
we
called
for
a
reservation
,
we
were
told
that
5:00
and
9:30
were
their
only
openings
.
When
we
arrived
at
5
,
and
left
circa
7
,
there
were
the
same
4
or
5
empty
tables
surrounding
us
.
Did
they
think
we
were
going
to
feel
lucky
to
get
any
reservation
at
all
,
and
therefore
be
more
pleased
with
our
dining
experience
?
MUST
READ
-
Do
not
waste
your
time
in
this
store
.
At
my
appointment
the
girl
helping
me
was
unable
to
adequately
lace
up
some
of
the
dresses
.
They
felt
like
they
were
going
to
fall
off
of
me
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
see
what
I
would
actually
look
like
were
I
to
purchase
some
of
these
dresses
.
I
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
see
how
a
few
that
I
liked
would
look
like
on
a
model
(
by
looking
the
dress
up
online
)
.
So
,
as
I
was
leaving
I
asked
for
the
designer
/
dress
name
or
style
number
associated
with
my
top
picks
.
They
said
they
were
"
unable
to
tell
me
until
they
ordered
my
dress
"
.
Hmmm
...
A
person
can
not
call
a
company
,
if
you
have
no
idea
its
name
(
since
the
designer
is
unknown
...
SUPPOSEDLY
)
,
and
order
a
gown
without
a
dress
name
or
style
number
.
Do
other
brides
fall
for
this
???
They
either
:
a
)
do
n't
want
to
give
it
to
me
because
they
do
n't
want
me
purchasing
the
dress
elsewhere
or
b
)
are
recreating
the
dresses
themselves
(
ie
STEALING
other
designers
'
dress
designs
and
"
filling
the
orders
"
by
their
own
seamstresses
)
.
I
'm
no
detective
but
...
uhh
...
seriously
?!?
Whatever
type
of
operation
they
are
running
,
I
'm
not
interested
and
if
you
're
smart
,
you
wo
n't
be
either
.
What
a
waste
of
TIME
.
Aside
from
that
little
*
mystery
*
,
one
of
the
sales
ladies
was
quite
comfortable
telling
me
how
wrong
I
was
about
how
another
dress
that
I
loved
compared
to
one
of
her
dresses
that
I
was
trying
on
.
Somehow
,
since
she
supposedly
does
n't
know
any
names
of
designers
/
dresses
,
after
I
told
her
the
designer
and
dress
name
of
the
one
I
was
comparing
,
she
knew
"
exactly
which
dress
"
I
was
referring
to
and
disagreed
with
my
observation
;
she
said
that
the
bodice
did
come
as
low
as
the
one
I
had
on
.
My
point
:
Even
if
I
was
wrong
,
do
n't
sit
there
and
argue
with
the
customer
.
Say
something
like
,
"
Huh
.
I
did
n't
think
so
but
you
could
be
right
.
"
Unless
you
want
to
take
the
"
tell
the
customer
how
wrong
she
is
and
try
and
force
her
into
a
dress
she
's
obviously
not
loving
"
approach
which
will
likely
get
you
...
uh
...
nowhere
.
Seriously
:
do
not
waste
your
time
.
Other
shops
around
this
city
have
MUCH
NICER
and
more
TRANSPARENT
owners
.
Not
owners
that
seem
like
they
have
something
to
hide
and
know
nothing
about
common
courtesy
and
customer
service
.
I
felt
very
much
like
Wedding
Gallery
was
being
dishonest
and
I
would
n't
trust
them
to
lace
me
up
in
another
gown
let
alone
trust
them
with
the
gown
I
will
wear
on
the
most
important
day
of
my
life
.
AWFUL
SERVICE
!
I
brought
my
car
in
on
a
Sunday
to
replace
a
shredded
tire
.
Once
inside
,
I
had
to
stand
around
for
at
least
10
more
minutes
before
--
FINALLY
--
a
technician
got
to
me
.
Once
I
returned
to
pick
up
my
car
,
you
can
believe
I
spent
quite
a
bit
MORE
time
standing
around
waiting
.
I
had
wanted
to
split
the
total
between
a
credit
card
and
check
card
since
I
was
being
reimbursed
for
the
tire
but
was
told
this
was
n't
possible
.
Once
I
actually
got
back
in
my
car
,
it
was
dirty
and
had
grease
all
over
the
steering
wheel
.
OK
,
one
bad
experience
...
fine
.
The
following
Friday
,
I
returned
with
my
car
to
go
ahead
and
replace
the
other
3
tires
,
which
were
worn
.
I
would
not
have
gone
back
,
but
I
could
n't
find
the
particular
tire
they
'd
used
in
stock
anywhere
else
.
Once
again
,
I
waited
for
quite
a
bit
before
being
attended
to
.
I
got
the
order
completed
,
and
then
questioned
the
technician
since
it
came
out
about
$
40
less
than
I
expected
.
He
said
it
was
the
same
tire
,
and
verified
this
,
after
checking
both
the
actual
tire
on
my
car
and
my
service
papers
from
earlier
in
the
week
.
However
,
when
he
printed
out
the
service
quote
,
I
could
see
that
it
was
NOT
the
correct
tire
,
and
was
not
even
an
appropriate
tire
for
my
car
model
.
So
I
pointed
this
out
to
him
,
at
which
point
he
said
they
only
had
one
of
the
correct
tires
in
stock
.
Ok
--
fine
.
So
I
got
just
my
other
rear
tire
replaced
.
They
promised
it
'd
be
done
within
an
hour
,
so
I
waited
in
the
lobby
.
A
few
minutes
after
I
left
,
I
was
called
and
informed
that
"
I
"
left
my
wheel
lock
(
which
they
should
have
left
in
the
car
)
.
Of
course
,
they
would
be
closing
in
5
minutes
,
so
I
would
have
to
hurry
up
or
get
it
the
next
day
.
Of
course
I
could
n't
make
it
back
in
time
(
and
they
apparently
could
not
stay
5
extra
minutes
to
wait
for
me
)
.
The
next
day
,
no
one
could
find
my
wheel
lock
and
that
particular
technician
was
not
in
.
On
Monday
I
called
and
again
it
was
a
big
to
-
do
to
find
anyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
.
Supposedly
they
will
be
holding
it
for
me
this
evening
,
but
I
'm
sure
that
will
also
be
a
huge
ordeal
.
